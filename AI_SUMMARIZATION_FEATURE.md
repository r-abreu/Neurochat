# üìù AI-Powered Ticket Summarization Feature

## Overview
The AI Summarization feature automatically generates concise, professional summaries of resolved support tickets using OpenAI's GPT models. This helps agents quickly understand ticket resolutions and improves knowledge management.

## ‚úÖ What's Implemented

### Backend Components
- **AI Summarization Service** (`backend/services/aiService.js`) - New `generateResolutionSummary()` method
- **Automatic Triggers** - Summarization triggered when tickets are marked "resolved"
- **Manual Generation API** - `/api/tickets/:ticketId/generate-summary` endpoint for manual regeneration
- **Database Schema** - New fields for storing summaries and metadata
- **Socket Events** - Real-time summary updates via `ticket_summary_generated` event

### Frontend Components
- **Ticket Detail View** - Summary display section with regeneration button
- **Agent Dashboard** - Tooltip preview of summaries on resolved tickets
- **TypeScript Types** - Updated Ticket interface with summary fields

### Key Features
- **Automatic Generation** - Triggers when ticket status changes to "resolved"
- **Manual Regeneration** - Agents can regenerate summaries via button
- **Model Version Tracking** - Tracks which AI model version generated each summary
- **Real-time Updates** - Socket.IO integration for live summary notifications
- **Tooltip Preview** - Hover over resolved tickets in dashboard to see summary
- **Professional Format** - Structured summaries focusing on issue, steps, and resolution

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Migration
Run the database migration to add summary fields:
```sql
-- Run this against your Azure SQL Database
USE NeuroChat;
GO

ALTER TABLE Tickets ADD 
    resolution_summary NVARCHAR(MAX) NULL,
    resolution_summary_generated_at DATETIME2 NULL,
    resolution_summary_model_version NVARCHAR(50) NULL,
    resolution_summary_generated_by UNIQUEIDENTIFIER NULL;

-- Add foreign key constraint
ALTER TABLE Tickets ADD CONSTRAINT FK_Tickets_SummaryGeneratedBy 
    FOREIGN KEY (resolution_summary_generated_by) REFERENCES Users(user_id);

-- Add index for performance
CREATE INDEX IX_Tickets_ResolutionSummary ON Tickets (resolution_summary_generated_at) 
WHERE resolution_summary IS NOT NULL;
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
Ensure your `.env` file includes:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
```

### 3. Restart Services
Restart both backend and frontend services to load the new features.

## üìã How It Works

### Automatic Summarization
1. **Trigger**: When a ticket status changes to "resolved" (by agent or customer)
2. **Data Collection**: System gathers:
   - Full conversation transcript (excluding system messages)
   - Ticket metadata (title, category, customer, device info)
   - Message timestamps and sender information
3. **AI Processing**: Sends structured prompt to OpenAI with instructions to:
   - Focus on main issue, troubleshooting steps, and resolution
   - Keep summary between 3-5 sentences
   - Use professional, technical language
   - Include specific product/error details when relevant
4. **Storage**: Saves summary with metadata (timestamp, model version, generated by)
5. **Notification**: Broadcasts update via Socket.IO to connected clients

### Manual Regeneration
- Agents with `tickets.edit` permission can click "Regenerate" button
- Forces new summary generation regardless of existing summary age
- Updates both local state and broadcasts to other connected users

### Summary Display
- **Ticket Detail**: Full summary with generation details in sidebar
- **Dashboard**: Hover tooltip showing summary preview on resolved tickets
- **Icon Indicator**: Small document icon on resolved tickets with summaries

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Example Summary Output
```
Issue: Customer reported BWIII device error code 500 preventing login access. 
Resolution: Agent identified corrupted configuration file and guided customer through device reset procedure. Customer confirmed successful login after factory reset and reconfiguration. Device now operating normally with latest firmware version.
```

### API Usage
```javascript
// Generate summary manually
const summaryData = await apiService.generateTicketSummary(ticketId);
console.log(summaryData.summary);
console.log(summaryData.modelVersion); // e.g., "gpt-4o"
console.log(summaryData.generatedAt);
```

## üîß Configuration Options

### AI Model Selection
- Default: `gpt-4o` (configurable in `aiService.js`)
- Temperature: `0.3` (lower for more consistent, factual summaries)
- Max tokens: `300` (optimal for 3-5 sentence summaries)

### Summary Triggers
- Agent marks ticket as "resolved"
- Customer closes ticket (with or without feedback)
- Manual regeneration by agents

### Permissions
- **View Summaries**: All agents can see summaries
- **Generate Summaries**: Requires `tickets.edit` permission
- **Auto-generation**: No permission required (system-triggered)

## üìä Analytics Integration

Summary data can be exported for analytics:
- Resolution patterns analysis
- Common issue identification
- Agent performance insights
- Knowledge base content generation

## üîç Technical Details

### Database Fields
- `resolution_summary`: The AI-generated summary text
- `resolution_summary_generated_at`: Timestamp of generation
- `resolution_summary_model_version`: AI model used (e.g., "gpt-4o")
- `resolution_summary_generated_by`: Agent who triggered manual generation

### Socket Events
- `ticket_summary_generated`: Broadcasts new summaries to connected clients
- Contains: ticketId, summary, generatedAt, modelVersion, confidence

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation if AI service unavailable
- Audit logging for both successful and failed generation attempts
- User-friendly error messages for manual generation failures

## üìà Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Summary quality scoring and feedback
- Bulk summary generation for historical tickets
- Summary-based ticket search functionality
- Multi-language summary support
- Integration with knowledge base systems
- Automated tagging based on summary content

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Summary Not Generated
1. Check OpenAI API key configuration
2. Verify ticket has conversation messages
3. Check browser console for error messages
4. Ensure user has proper permissions

### Poor Summary Quality
1. Verify conversation has sufficient content
2. Check if technical details are present in messages
3. Consider manual regeneration for better results

### Performance Issues
1. Monitor AI service response times
2. Check database query performance on summary fields
3. Verify Socket.IO connection stability
