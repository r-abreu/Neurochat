# Role Permission Fix Summary

## Issue Description

**Problem**: Tier 2 users were able to see and access Role Management functionality even though they should not have permission to do so, while still properly being restricted from User Management.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by a mismatch between the database schema and the frontend permission checks:

### Database Schema Issues
1. **Missing System Permissions**: The database schema (`database/schema.sql`) was missing several key system permissions that the frontend code was checking for:
   - `system.management`
   - `system.settings`
   - `system.ai_settings`
   - `system.user_management`
   - `system.role_management`
   - Various device and company management permissions

2. **Incomplete Role Assignments**: The Tier2 role was only assigned basic permissions like `users.access`, but the frontend was looking for more specific permissions like `system.role_management`.

### Frontend Permission Logic
The frontend components had proper permission checks in place:

**UserManagement.tsx** (lines 26-28):
```typescript
const hasUserManagementAccess = (user?.permissions?.includes('users.access') || user?.permissions?.includes('system.user_management')) ?? false;
const hasRoleManagementAccess = (user?.permissions?.includes('system.role_management') || user?.permissions?.includes('system.management') || user?.roleName === 'Admin') ?? false;
```

**Sidebar.tsx** (line 332):
```typescript
{user?.userType === 'agent' && user.permissions?.includes('system.management') && (
```

## The Fix

### 1. Database Migration (`database/migration_fix_role_permissions.sql`)

Added missing system permissions:
- `system.management` - Full system management access
- `system.settings` - System settings management  
- `system.ai_settings` - AI system settings management
- `system.user_management` - User management access
- `system.role_management` - Role management access
- Device management permissions (`devices.view`, `devices.create`, `devices.edit`, `devices.delete`)
- Company management permissions (`companies.view`, `companies.create`, `companies.edit`, `companies.delete`)

### 2. Role Permission Assignments

**Admin Role**: Gets all permissions (including `system.role_management`)

**Tier2 Role**: Gets comprehensive permissions EXCEPT `system.role_management`:
- All ticket operations
- `system.user_management` (can manage users)
- `users.access`, `users.create`, `users.edit`
- Customer, device, and company management
- Insights and audit viewing

**Tier1 Role**: Gets basic permissions:
- Ticket operations
- View-only access to customers, devices, companies

**Viewer Role**: Gets read-only access to all main entities

### 3. Key Security Improvement

**Critical Change**: Only the Admin role now has `system.role_management` permission, ensuring that:
- ✅ Admin users can access Role Management
- ❌ Tier2 users cannot access Role Management  
- ✅ Tier2 users can still access User Management
- ❌ Tier1 and Viewer users cannot access either

## Files Modified

1. **`database/migration_fix_role_permissions.sql`** - New migration file
2. **`run_permission_fix.ps1`** - PowerShell script to apply the migration

## How to Apply the Fix

1. Run the migration script:
   ```powershell
   .\run_permission_fix.ps1
   ```

2. Restart the backend server

3. Refresh the frontend application

## Verification

After applying the fix, you should see:

- **Admin users**: Can see both "User Management" and "Role Management" tabs
- **Tier2 users**: Can see "User Management" tab only (Role Management tab will be hidden)
- **Tier1 users**: Cannot access the System Management section at all
- **Viewer users**: Cannot access the System Management section at all

## Security Impact

This fix closes a security gap where Tier2 users had unintended access to role management functionality, which could have allowed them to:
- View role configurations
- Potentially modify role permissions (depending on backend validation)
- See system-level permission structures

With this fix, role management is now properly restricted to Admin users only.
