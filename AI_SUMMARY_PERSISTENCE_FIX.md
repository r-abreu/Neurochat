# AI Summary Persistence Fix

## üö® Problem Identified

The AI summaries were disappearing because they were not being properly saved to the database. The issue was that:

1. **Database Schema Missing Fields**: The main `database/schema.sql` file did not include the AI summary fields
2. **Separate Migration**: The AI summary fields were only in a separate migration file that may not have been run
3. **Field Name Mismatch**: Backend code uses camelCase (`resolutionSummary`) while database uses snake_case (`resolution_summary`)

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Main Database Schema

Added the following fields to the `Tickets` table in `database/schema.sql`:

```sql
-- AI Summary fields (for ticket resolution summaries)
resolution_summary NVARCHAR(MAX) NULL,
resolution_summary_generated_at DATETIME2 NULL,
resolution_summary_model_version NVARCHAR(50) NULL,
resolution_summary_generated_by UNIQUEIDENTIFIER NULL
```

### 2. Added Foreign Key Constraint

```sql
FOREIGN KEY (resolution_summary_generated_by) REFERENCES Users(user_id),
```

### 3. Added Performance Index

```sql
INDEX IX_Tickets_ResolutionSummary (resolution_summary_generated_at) WHERE resolution_summary IS NOT NULL,
```

### 4. Created Comprehensive Migration

Created `database/migration_ensure_ai_summary_fields.sql` that:
- Checks if each field exists before adding it
- Handles existing databases gracefully
- Adds proper constraints and indexes
- Provides clear feedback during execution

## üöÄ How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Run the Migration Script (Recommended)

```powershell
# Run the PowerShell migration script
./run_ai_summary_migration.ps1
```

### Option 2: Manual Database Update

1. Open SQL Server Management Studio
2. Connect to your Azure SQL Database
3. Run the contents of `database/migration_ensure_ai_summary_fields.sql`

### Option 3: Recreate Database (For Development)

If you're using a development database, you can recreate it with:

```sql
-- Drop and recreate database with updated schema
DROP DATABASE NeuroChat;
-- Then run the updated database/schema.sql
```

## üîç Verification Steps

After applying the fix:

1. **Check Database Schema**:
   ```sql
   SELECT COLUMN_NAME, DATA_TYPE, IS_NULLABLE
   FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS 
   WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'Tickets' 
   AND COLUMN_NAME LIKE '%resolution_summary%';
   ```

2. **Test AI Summary Generation**:
   - Create or resolve a ticket
   - Generate an AI summary
   - Refresh the page to verify it persists

3. **Check Backend Logs**:
   - Look for any database-related errors
   - Verify summary generation success messages

## üìä Database Field Mapping

| Backend (camelCase) | Database (snake_case) | Type | Purpose |
|---------------------|----------------------|------|---------|
| `resolutionSummary` | `resolution_summary` | NVARCHAR(MAX) | The AI-generated summary text |
| `resolutionSummaryGeneratedAt` | `resolution_summary_generated_at` | DATETIME2 | When the summary was created |
| `resolutionSummaryModelVersion` | `resolution_summary_model_version` | NVARCHAR(50) | AI model used (e.g., "gpt-4o") |
| `resolutionSummaryGeneratedBy` | `resolution_summary_generated_by` | UNIQUEIDENTIFIER | User who triggered generation |

## üõ†Ô∏è Backend Code Handling

The backend properly handles the field name conversion between camelCase (JavaScript) and snake_case (SQL). The AI summary generation code in `backend/server.js` correctly saves to:

- `ticket.resolutionSummary`
- `ticket.resolutionSummaryGeneratedAt`  
- `ticket.resolutionSummaryModelVersion`
- `ticket.resolutionSummaryGeneratedBy`

## üîÆ Benefits After Fix

1. **Persistent Summaries**: AI summaries will no longer disappear after page refresh
2. **Audit Trail**: Track who generated summaries and when
3. **Performance**: Proper indexing for summary-related queries
4. **Reliability**: Database constraints ensure data integrity
5. **Future-Proof**: Schema properly supports all AI summary features

## üß™ Testing the Fix

Run the persistence test to verify everything works:

```powershell
# Test AI summary persistence
./test_summary_persistence.ps1
```

This test will:
- Generate an AI summary
- Wait 5 seconds
- Check if the summary still exists
- Verify it persists across requests

## üìù Migration History

- **Original**: AI summary fields only in migration file
- **Updated**: Fields included in main schema
- **Enhanced**: Added comprehensive migration with existence checks
- **Documented**: Full explanation and verification steps

The AI summaries should now persist properly in the database! üéâ
