# üéØ Full Ticket Urgency System Implementation

## Overview

The **Enhanced Ticket Urgency System** provides real-time visual, audio, and behavioral feedback to help agents quickly identify and respond to tickets requiring immediate attention. The system tracks ticket status transitions and applies configurable color coding, sound notifications, and blinking animations to enhance operational awareness.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Real-time blinking animations** when urgency levels change
- **Configurable blink duration** (5-60 seconds)
- **Enhanced warning messages** with context-specific descriptions

### üîä Audio Notifications
- **Distinct sound signatures** for each urgency level
- **Repeating alert sounds** for yellow and red urgency levels
- **Configurable repeat intervals** (1-30 minutes)
- **Individual sound enable/disable** controls per urgency level

### ‚öôÔ∏è Full Configuration
- **System Settings integration** for all timing thresholds
- **Real-time settings updates** without page refresh
- **Admin-only configuration** access
- **Persistent settings** across sessions

## üß© Urgency Logic Sections

### Section 1: Assignment-Based Warnings
These conditions apply to unassigned or AI-handled tickets.

#### 1. AI Handling ‚Äì Initial (üü¢ Green)
- **Condition**: AI agent responds to new chat
- **Message**: "ü§ñ AI interaction ongoing"
- **Purpose**: Signals AI is active; human action not yet needed
- **Behavior**: Blink for configured duration, play green tone (if enabled)

#### 2. Customer Requests Human (üü° Yellow)
- **Condition**: Customer asks to speak to a real person
- **Message**: "üü° Human Agent requested, claim ticket now"
- **Purpose**: AI detected user wants human; agent must act
- **Behavior**: Blink + sound warning every X minutes (configurable)

#### 3. Ignored Human Request (üî¥ Red)
- **Condition**: No agent response after human request > configured time
- **Message**: "üö® Urgent! Human agent must take this ticket NOW"
- **Purpose**: Escalates inaction to critical level
- **Behavior**: Blink + urgent sound every X minutes

#### 4. Unassigned Ticket ‚Äì No AI Response (üü¢‚Üíüü°‚Üíüî¥)
- **0-1 min (Green)**: "üÜï Customer waiting for an agent"
- **>1 min (Yellow)**: "‚ö†Ô∏è Customer waiting >1 min, claim ticket ASAP"
- **>3 min (Red)**: "üî• Customer waiting too long, claim ticket NOW!"

### Section 2: Status-Based Warnings
These warnings apply after a ticket is claimed by a human agent.

#### 1. Ticket In Progress (<5 min, üü¢ Green)
- **Message**: "‚úã Support in progress (<5 min)"
- **Purpose**: Informative ‚Äî indicates normal support time
- **Behavior**: Blink for configured duration, green tone (if enabled)

#### 2. Support Taking Longer (>5 min, üü° Yellow)
- **Message**: "‚è∞ Support taking longer than expected (>5 min)"
- **Purpose**: Light alert ‚Äî might need follow-up or escalation
- **Behavior**: Blink + yellow sound every X minutes

#### 3. Support Delayed (>10 min, üî¥ Red)
- **Message**: "üî• Support taking too long ‚Äî escalate now!"
- **Purpose**: Critical ‚Äî ticket is aging, possibly stuck
- **Behavior**: Blink + red alert sound every X minutes
