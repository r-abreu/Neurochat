Return to the correct operating limit and wait for two hours before starting it again.\n\n Cleaning\n\nCleaning of Parts\n\nThe cleaning of parts is recommended; however, the equipment must be unplugged, and it must be done using a dry cloth. It is not necessary to sterilize the modules and cables as they are non-invasive use and non-sterile.\n\nWe do not recommend the use of any type of liquid solution for the cleaning of any BWIII family of equipment. This equipment is not waterproof.\n\nCleaning of parts and accessories\n\nWe recommend the disinfection of sensors and electrodes with a piece of cloth slightly moistened by hydrated ethyl alcohol. It is not necessary to sterilize the pieces (electrodes and sensors). Non-invasive use, non-sterile.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tDo not leave the sensors and electrodes wet for more than 5  \n\n             minutes. \n\n\n\n\n\n Sterilization\n\nThe BWIII family of equipment (Parts and Accessories) does not need to be sterilized. Non-invasive use, non-sterile.\n\n Pieces that touch the patient’s skin\n\nFor those pieces that touch with the patient, we recommend them to comply with ISO 10993 standard for the biocompatibility guarantee.\n\n Disposal \n\nThe disposal of parts, pieces and accessories is the manufacturer’s responsibility.\n\nWhenever it is necessary to dispose of any parts, pieces and accessories that are part of BWIII equipment, the client will be able to send that material to be disposed, duly identified, so that Neurovirtual can proceed with the disposal. \n\nThe client is responsible for the costs of sending those products to be disposed by Neurovirtual.\n\nNeurovirtual is not responsible for the accomplishment of such act, which is the client’s express responsibility and initiative. There is no restriction regarding the disposal in public landfills, however, with the environmental awareness, Neurovirtual can offer an adequate disposal for those products that it manufactures.\n\n Preventive and Corrective Maintenance and Calibration\n\nLifetime\n\nThe lifetime of equipment BWIII is 7 years.\n\nThe lifetime of the accompanying accessories is different depending on the sensor.\n\nAuthorization\n\nIn case the equipment presents any problem, the user should contact the manufacturer through customer service to gather information regarding which companies are authorized to accomplish the maintenance service.\n\nPreventive Inspection \n\nWe recommend a daily visual inspection to guarantee the integrity of connections, cables, cabinets, electrodes, and sensors.\n\nCorrective Maintenance \n\nIn the event of any other type of defect, the user should contact Neurovirtual Customer Service to obtain the solution. Additional charges may apply to equipment whose warranty term is exceeded or for those defects that are not covered by the warranty terms.\n\nNeurovirtual does not provide the Technical Files, the Product Master Registration and the Calibration and Measurement Instructions, except when requested by the client at the time of the equipment purchase. A confidentiality agreement might be demanded and there might some costs for the supply.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\tNeurovirtual is not responsible for any equipment repaired by those companies that do not have its express authorization, exempting itself from any legal responsibility that might arise to the patient, user, operator, owner and any third parties.\n\n\n\n Electromagnetic Emission - EMC\n\nSome types of interferences \n\n60 HZ Interferences: Usually produced by the lack of proper grounding in the location where the examinations are conducted, broken electrodes, poor placement of electrodes causing high impedance, places with high incidence of radio frequency (RF).\n\nEnvironment interference: They can come from several sources:\n\nExamples: Power lines and transformers near the equipment, strong signals of broadcast TV, radio, airports, police, large equipment such as tomography, magnetic resonance, nuclear, electric treadmill. \n\nThe artifacts from these natures are easier to be identified because the contamination is widespread, there is, it simultaneously appears on all channels.\n\nArtifacts caused by phones: They are usually generators of electromagnetic waves generally coming in on the same frequencies of the equipment. Caused by modulation by pulse in phone dialing.\n\nTo avoid interference, it is necessary to have the equipment correctly installed by following all the requirements necessary to eliminate any interference from the power grid.\n\nIf you are experiencing some of the interference, please contact Neurovirtual Customer Support for guidance. There might be the recommendation for the hiring of a specialized technician by the client / owner so that he/she can check the immunity conditions of the environment where the tests are being conducted.\n\nNeurovirtual is not responsible for the costs associated to such inspection / correction, as well as it does not have any responsibility to ensure that the environment where the tests are performed be immune to any interference. That responsibility lies with the client. \n\nElectromagnetic Emission Safety Advisory - EMC\n\nRF communication equipment (Radio Frequency) marked with the symbol can affect the functioning of BWIII family equipment. Avoid the use of such equipment in the vicinity of BWIII equipment (models: BWIII EEG and BWIII PSG).\n\nEnvironments close to equipment such as Magnetic Resonance, Tomography, X-ray, equipment operating at high frequencies and high sources of electromagnetic emission (EMC) can cause the BWIII family equipment to suffer interference (easily detected by the operator because they differ from the physiological electrical patterns). However, the use in these environments is not risky for the operator or the patient. In case there is any deficiency during the use in these environments, we recommend the BWIII family equipment to be re-oriented.\n\nBWIII family Equipment can be connected to public power grid or the electrical network of hospitals because it does not emit high levels of electromagnetic emissions.\n\n\n\nThe use of accessories other than those specified in such User Instructions might result in increased emissions of electromagnetic emission (EMC) or decreased immunity.\n\nEquipment that can be connected to the Amplifier Module of BWIII\n\nWe ask our clients to ask for orientation from Neurovirtual Technical Support before connecting any equipment (Electromedical Active) to BWIII PSG to ensure its correct compatibility and operation, thus ensuring operator’s and the patient’s safety.\n\nEquipment such as CPAP, BiPAP and VPAP (fans) can be connected to the equipment model BWIII PSG through the DC input, if they are electrical equipment certified by the electrical safety standards. However, we ask customers to get in touch with the Customer Support to obtain the list of approved devices, as well as Instructions and Recommendations for a perfect and safe connection.\n\nAny electromedical equipment that is not certified (assets) should not be connected to the BWIII PSG equipment without written consent from Neurovirtual.\n\nElectromagnetic disturbance\n\nDuring eventual electromagnetic disturbances, which affect the essential performance of the device, there will be a noticeable degradation of the physiological signals displayed during registration, this degradation differs from the physiological signals and should be interpreted / considered as artifacts (interferences), in this situation we recommend that the user stop and disregard the record until disturbances cease.\n\nMaintenance of the system regarding electromagnetic immunity\n\na) Periodic maintenance of the grounding circuit of the environment (annually)\n\nb) Precaution to avoid sources of electromagnetic energy such as FM / AM TV antennas, and other potential sources of electromagnetic emission in the vicinity of the registration site.\n\nc) Do not use the BWMini simultaneously with high frequency surgical equipment.\n\nd) Avoid stacking the BWMini with other active devices.\n\ne) Portable RF communication equipment (including peripherals such as antenna cables and external antennas) should not be used within 30 cm of any part of the BWMini, including cables specified by the manufacturer. Otherwise, performance degradation of this equipment may occur.\n\nTables and guidelines on Electromagnetic Emissions - EMC\n\nHere are the tables containing important information regarding electromagnetic compatibility.\n\n\n\n\n\nRef.: IEC 60601-1-2 - Table 201 \n\nGuidance and Manufacturer’s Declaration – Electromagnetic Emission – EMC – for all EQUIPMENTS and SYSTEMS (VER 6.8.3.201 a) 3).\n\nGuidance and manufacturer’s declaration – Electromagnetic Emission - EMC\n\nThe BWIII family equipment is intended for use in the electromagnetic environment specified below.

In most cases, ESD currents travel to earth through the metal chassis frame of a device. However, it is well known that the current will travel on all available paths. In some cases, a path may be between PN junctions in integrated circuits to reach the ground. This current flow will burn openings invisible to the naked eye in an integrated circuit, with evidence of heat damage in the surrounding area. An ESD event will not interrupt equipment operation. However, repeated events will degrade the internal components of the equipment over time.\n\n\n\nIntroduction to ESD \n\n\n\n \n\nElectrostatic discharge (ESD) has been occurring since the beginning of time. However, this natural phenomenon has become a problem with the widespread use of solid-state electronic components.\n\n\n\nESD Generating sources\n\n\n\nAll materials (Insulators and Conductors) are sources of ESD. They are grouped together and known as the triboelectric series, which defines the materials associated with positive or negative charges.\n\n            \n\nPositive charges accumulate predominantly on human or animal skin. Negative charges are more common to synthetic materials such as Styrofoam or plastic cups. The amount of electrostatic charge that can accumulate on any item depends on its ability to store a charge. For example, the human body can store a charge equal to 250 picofarads. This correlates with a stored load that can be as high as 25,000Volts.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n\nStatic control on personnel and handling equipment\n\n  People are usually the generators of static electricity. The simple act of walking or the movements necessary to repair a circuit board can generate several thousand volts of electrostatic charge in the human body. If not properly controlled, this static charge can easily discharge into an ESD-sensitive device - a typical human body model discharge. In addition, a person may transfer charge to a circuit board or other item making it vulnerable to Device Model events loaded in a subsequent process.\n\nEven in highly automated assembly and testing processes, people still deal with ESDS ... in the warehouse, in repair, in the lab, in transportation. For this reason, ESD control programs place considerable emphasis on personnel-generated electrostatic discharge control. Likewise, the movement of moving equipment (such as trolleys or carts) and other wheeled equipment through the facility can also generate substantial static loads that can be transferred to the products being transported in this facility. \n\n\n\nESD Identification\n\n\n\n  A final element in our ESD control program is the use of appropriate symbols to identify ESD sensitive items as well as special products designed to control ESD. The two most widely accepted symbols for identifying ESD parts or ESD control protection materials are defined in the ESD ANSI / ESD S8.1 - ESD Association Standard.\n\n \n\n  The ESD Susceptibility Symbol (Figure 3) consists of a triangle, a reach hand, and a bar on the approaching hand. The triangle means \"caution\" and the bar across the reach hand means \"do not touch\". Due to its widespread use, the hand on the triangle has become associated with ESD and the symbol literally translates to \"ESD sensitive material, not touch\".\n\n  The ESD Susceptibility Symbol is applied directly to integrated circuits, boards, and assemblies that are ESD sensitive. Indicates that handling or use of this item may result in damage caused by ESD if proper precautions are not taken. Operators must be grounded prior to handling. If desired, the item's sensitivity level can be added to the label.\n\nHow does ESD occur?\n\n\n\n   ESD can occur in a variety of ways. One of the most common is through human contact with sensitive devices. Human touch is only sensitive at ESD levels exceeding 4,000 Volts.\n\n  A recent investigation found the human body and its clothing capable of storing between 500Volts and 2,500Volts electrostatic during the normal working day. This is far above the level that damages circuits still below the threshold of human perception. Other sources of ESD damage to equipment include:\n\n• Troubleshooting electronic equipment or handling printed circuit boards without using an electrostatic wrist strap.\n\n• Placing synthetic materials (i.e., plastic, Styrofoam, etc.) in or near electronic equipment; and\n\n• Rapid air movement near electronic equipment (including the use of compressed air to remove dirt from printed circuit boards, circulation fans that explode in electronic equipment or by using an electronic device near an air handling system).\n\nIn all these scenarios, the accumulation of static rates may occur, but you may never know. In addition, a loaded object must not necessarily contact the item for an ESD event to occur.\n\nHow do you measure electrostatic voltage?\n\nOne of the most effective ways to identify potential ESD problem areas is to take measurements using an electrostatic voltmeter. This meter will effectively measure electrostatic voltage up to 30,000V on all conductors and isolators. It will also show whether the charge is negative or positive. This can help you determine the source of electrostatic accumulation.\n\n\n\n\n\nAntistatic wire strap\n\n\n\nTypically, wrist straps are the primary means of grounding personnel. When properly placed and grounded, a bracelet keeps the wearer close to the earth potential. Since the person and other grounded objects in the work area are at or near the same potential, there can be no hazardous discharge between them. In addition, static charges are removed from the person to ground and do not accumulate. When personnel are seated in a chair that is not EPA-appropriate, they should be grounded using a wrist strap.\n\n\n\n  Wrist straps have two main components, the bracelet that surrounds the person's wrist and the ground cable that connects the bracelet to the common point. Most wrist straps have a current limiting resistor molded into the grounding cable at the end that attaches to the strap. This resistor is most commonly a megohm, with at least 1/4 watt with a working voltage of 250 volts.\n\nWrist straps have various failure mechanisms and therefore should be tested regularly. Daily testing at specific test stations or using a continuous monitor on the workbench is recommended.\n\n\n\nFloors, Rugs, Floor Finishes\n\n  A second method of grounding personnel is an ESD floor covering / footwear system in conjunction with ESD control footwear or foot bases. This combination of conductive or dissipative tread materials and footwear provides a safe dirt path for electrostatic charge dissipation, thereby reducing load accumulation on personnel. In addition to the dissipation load, some floor materials (and floor finishes) also reduce triboelectric charging. The use of a covering / footwear system is especially appropriate in areas where greater staff mobility is required. In addition, floor materials can minimize load accumulation on chairs, moving equipment (such as trolleys and trolleys), lifting trucks and other objects that move across the floor. However, these items require disabling or driving wheels or wheels to make electrical contact with the ground and components to be electrically connected. When used as a personnel grounding system, ground resistance, including person, footwear, and ground, must be the same as specified for the wrist straps (<35 megohms) and accumulation body tension in a standard stress test. (ANSI / ESD STM97. 2) must be less than 100 volts.\n\nShoes, bases, casters\n\n   Used in combination with ESD flooring, static control shoes, foot stands, casters and wheels provide the necessary electrical contact between the person or object and the floor. Footwear, casters or insulating wheels prevent static charges from flowing from the body or moving equipment to the ground floor and should therefore be avoided.\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\nWorkstations and work areas\n\n\n\nAn ESD protective workstation refers to a single individual work area that is constructed and equipped with materials and equipment to limit damage to ESD sensitive items. It can be a standalone station in a warehouse, warehouse, or assembly area, or in a field location, such as a computer bay on commercial aircraft. A workstation may also be in a controlled area, such as a clean room. The main ESD control elements that make up most workstations are a static dissipative work surface, personnel grounding (usually a wristband), a common point, and proper signaling and labeling. A typical workstation is shown in Figure 1.\n\nThe workstation provides a means to connect all work areas, electrical devices, handling equipment, and grounding devices to a common point. In addition, provision may be made for connecting additional personnel grounding devices, equipment, and accessories such as continuous or continuous monitors and ionizers.\n\nStatic protective work surfaces with 1 mega-ohm to 1 giga-ohm ground resistance provide a surface that has the same electrical potential as other ESD control items on the workstation. They also provide an electrical ground path for controlled dissipation of any static charges on surface contacting materials. The work surface also helps define a specific work area in which ESDS should be handled. The work surface is connected to the common point.\n\nClothing\n\nClothes\n\n   Clothing is a consideration in some ESD protection areas, especially in clean rooms and very dry environments. Garment materials, particularly those made of synthetic fabrics, can generate electrostatic charges that can discharge into ESDS or can create electrostatic fields that can induce charges. Because clothing is usually electrically insulated or insulated from the body, the charges on clothing fabrics are not necessarily dissipated on the skin and then ground. Statically controlled clothing may suppress or otherwise affect an electric field of clothing worn under the garment. By ANSI / ESD S20.20 and the ANSI / ESD STM2.1 clothing standard, there are three categories of ESD clothing:\n\n• ESD Category 1 clothing; a static control suit without being earthed. However, without grounding, a charge can accumulate on conductive or dissipative elements of a garment, if present, resulting in a charged source.\n\n• ESD Category 2 clothing; A static control clothing that can be grounded when grounded provides a higher level of suppression of the effects of an electric field from worn clothing under the garment.\n\n• ESD Category 3 clothing; A static and isolable control garment system also links a person's skin with an identified land path. Total system resistance, including person, clothing, and grounding wire should be less than 35 megohms.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblems and Possible Solutions\n\nFailure connecting to the data server.\n\n\n\n1st Check if the equipment is correctly connected to the electrical network.\n\n2nd Check if the equipment has its Ethernet communication cable correctly connected   \n\nto the computer.\n\n3rd Check if the network connection IP address is correct.\n\n4th Check if the green and orange lights, close to the Ethernet connection are on.\n\n5th Check Control Panel🡺network connections\" if the network connection⎝used is enabled.\n\n6th Check if the driver of the computer Ethernet card is correctly installed. \n\n7th Check if the Ethernet communication cable (crossover, standard: T568A at one end and T568B at the other).\n\n\n\nHigh-Frequency Interferences \"Bold Trace\".\n\n1st Check if the outlet being is used effectively grounded.\n\n2nd Check if the electrode placement impedances are low.\n\n3rd Check if there is any sweat or dirt residue on the patient’s head.\n\n4th Check if the electrodes are in perfect conditions for use.\n\n\n\nAmplifier Module Green Light is not lit.\n\n1st Check if the source is connected to the electrical grid.\n\n2nd Check if the source is connected to the amplifier module.\n\n\n\nPhoto-Stimulator (Stimulator Flash) does not light.\n\n1st Check if the Flash Stimulator communication cable is connected to the EEG Amplifier Module and Flash Stimulator.\n\n2nd Check if there is no damage to the Flash Stimulator Cable Communication. \n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the tests, if the problem persists, the user should contact Neurovirtual Customer Support. \n\nInterruption of system electrical power\n\n\n\nIn case of an interruption of electrical power for less than 30 seconds, the device and the software will keep the settings until the power is restored. \n\n\n\nIn case of an interruption of electrical power for more than 30 seconds, the device and the software will keep the last settings used to record the study.\n\n\n\nAfter the tests, if the problem persists, the user should contact Neurovirtual Customer Support.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tAny perception or suspect of abnormal functioning, we recommend the operator to immediately get in touch with Neurovirtual Customer Support for verification.\n\n\n\n\n\n About this Manual\n\nNeurovirtual reserves the right to modify the content of this manual without any previous notice.\n\nThe images shown in this manual are mere illustrations.\n\nMany products shown in this material are optional.\n\n\n\n\n\n Copyright©\n\nThe content of this document (User Instruction) belongs to Neurovirtual, and it cannot be altered, reproduced, or used with commercial intentions of any kind without the express permission from its owner.\n\nThe brands and logos presented are trademarks from their respective manufacturers.",

On EEG studies, Insert Measurement can be insert also from the right-click on trace.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter that, the cursor will become a measurement instrument. Click on a determined wave and drag the mouse, determining the wave area to be measured. Thus, the user will obtain the time, the frequency and width of the measured wave. \n\n\n\n\n\nEach measurement will be shown in the plot as a red box, and only when you place the cursor over this box, it will turn blue and show the information of the measurement. To have more detailed information, double-click on the measure box. The new window will show Time, Amplitude and Frequency details, as well as a Spectrum graphic of the selected wave.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMontages Editor\n\nThe Software has several default montages, which can be changed from the dropdown menu on the Control Bar (see item 7.2.1.3 on page 71). All of the montages can be modified or removed as required, as well as adding other montages by creating them. To manage all of those actions, use the button  from the Tool Toolbar.\n\n\n\nA new window will open where the list of montages set for the used amplifier.\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\nTo create a new montage, click on the New button. To modify an existing one, select the montage and click on Edit button. To delete an existing montage, select the montage and click on the Delete button.\n\n\n\nWhen selecting Edit or New, a new window will open allowing to make the modifications or create an assembly from scratch. Note that the display of the channels depends on the equipment to be used. If the equipment is  PSG Plus or an EEG Plus, the user will be able to choose between the amplifier display and the headbox display. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n\n\n\n\nDepending on the equipment and the type of study, the channels that can be chosen will also be shown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn configuration\n\nFrom this window, it can be selected the channel to use, the required reference and the different configurations of these channels, such as: scale, filters, show trace or numeric, color, associated events, type of signal, among others.\n\nA       B     C       D           E              F         G        H          I         J            K              L         M     N       O           P            Q          R        S        T\n\n |       |      |        |           |              |          |         |          |         |            |               |          |      |        |           |              |          |         |        |\n\n\n\n\n\nName: Set any name required after having configured the channel. It is recommended a short name to avoid taking space of the trace.\n\nActive: Active is the principal channel that will be chosen first.\n\nRef: Reference electrode. If monopolar channel, choose after active. If bipolar channel, the REF channel should be automatically chosen.\n\nScale: The default sensitivity that the channel has in the montage. Set a medium value that avoid it being too small or overlap others. \n\nLow Freq Filter: Low cut filter. Depending on the type of signal will be the value that will be given.\n\nHigh Freq Filter: High cut filter. Depending on the type of signal will be the value that will be given.\n\nLinked: Channels that are linked will respond to the external settings of the Control Toolbar. Own Filters and Sensitivity will be locked.\n\nShow Trace: Allows the signal trace of that channel to be seen. If the channel is a numeric value, you may see only a straight line.\n\nShow Numeric: Allows the alphanumeric value of the channel to be seen. If the channel does not have a number, you will see two lines indicating no value \"--\" periodically.\n\nColor: A different color can be set for each channel. The software has 42 different colors to choose from.\n\nData Types: Determines which type of data belongs to each channel. \n\nAssociated Event: Determines the type of event which will be associated to the different sub-events that can be scored on the channel.\n\nFilter: Applies the high-cut and low-cut filters. If not checked, the signal will show the raw acquisition and might show noise.\n\nReverse: It is only used when the signal is upside down, to invert it.\n\nAuxLines: Sets lines above and below as peak-to-peak indicator or range measurement limit.\n\nAuxL Type Group: When enabled, all channels with the same Data Type will enabled the Auxiliar Lines.\n\nAuxLines Vpp: Establishes the Auxiliar Lines uV peak to peak range that will be applied to each channel.\n\nAutoScale: The computer automatically adjusts the sensitivity.\n\nClip Wave: This option completely flattens the top curve of the wave, if it exceeds the maximum amplitude of its channel.\n\nEKG filter: Allows filtering the EKG wave from the channel. \n\n \n\nThe sensitivity of this montage can also be modified, both individually and for all the linked channels. It is important to note that the higher the sensitivity number, the less amplitude the wave will be seen and vice versa, additionally. \n\n\n\nEEG Channels\n\nSelect the monopolar channel and the reference, which in this case must be another monopolar channel. For example, to create the F3-A2 channel, select the Active channel by clicking on F3, then select the REF channel by clicking on A2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe row will be created with the default parameters for an EEG channel with Linked option enabled, meaning that the Sensibility, High-cut and Low-cut filters are disabled. Those settings can be configured from the Control Toolbar. All manually added channels will have Black as default color, which can be changed from its dropdown menu.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen adding each channel, a new blank row will automatically be added under it. If an error message appears instead of the new blank row, the user needs to set the number of channels required for the montage. \n\n\n\nDepending on the device in use, the user will have the option to add, remove or move between the configured channels with the buttons , if available. Otherwise, the user can use the right click menu options.\n\n\n\nPSG Channels\n\nSelect the bipolar channel, if selected from the headbox, the REF will be automatically ser as REF (channel). If selected from the amplifier, the user might require selecting the REF channel manually.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe row will be created with the default parameters for each PSG channel. Those parameters depend on the type of signal that is going to be acquired.

To do this, click on the Acquisition dropdown menu, then select the Save Montage option. This will overwrite the original montage. In case its needed to save as a new montage, select the Save Montage As option, which will create a new one with the name assigned.\n\n\n\n                 \n\n\n\nTo save the changes done on each channel automatically, the user can check the Save Automatically checkbox from Montage Editor window. This option is not recommended for institutions where the computer is used by multiple users, as this option will permanently modify the original setup, which may alter the view for the next user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilters\n\nThe software offers two functions to filter the signals and improve their quality. Use the Button  in order to turn on the 50/60Hz filter. Use the button  in order to turn on the digital pass filter. Both filters are used to remove and filter out other types of noise and artifacts in the signal. Example: Both Filters OFF vs Both Filters ON\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, while the exam is under acquisition or review, modifications may need to be done to the high and low filters in a general montage or in a specific channel. \n\n\n\nTo modify the Low Frequency (Left) or High Frequency (Right) filters of the entire trace (signals linked), locate the Control toolbar and choose the Filters dropdown list. If the filters are grayed out, the notch and digital filter buttons from the Tool Toolbar might be disable. Enable both buttons to be able to modify the filter values. If the value to be chosen is not in the list, refer to the Filters tab from Configurations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo modify the filters for a specific channel, double-click on the channel name to open the Channel properties. Verify that the Filter checkbox is enabled for the filter values to be applied to the channel. When finished, click on apply and accept.\n\n\n\n  \n\nNote that in EEG, the filters are disabled, since in most EEG setups, the channels are linked. If needed, disable the Linked checkbox to be able to modify the filters. When finished, click on apply and accept.\n\n \n\n\n\nThe change of the filters can also be done by locating the cursor on top of the name of the channel, then right-click to access the channel settings in a list. Choose the Low Freq Filter or High Freq Filter option to display the list of values and select the desired one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmplitude Tracker\n\nThe amplitude of any wave in the trace can be verified by using the Amplitude Tracker. Use the  button, located in the Navigation Toolbar, to enable this feature. It will show a measure in microvolts (uV) for each wave at the right side of the screen, the value will change when moving the mouse cursor along the path.\n\n\n\n\n\nZoom\n\nThe Zoom tool allows to select parts of the path to increase its size and see a wave in more detail. Use the  button to active the feature, then choose a section of the trace by clicking and dragging. A new window is opened, displaying sliding bar which will allow to increase the size of the image and therefore have a zooming in option.\n\n\n\n\n\nLive Review\n\nThis tool allows the user to review and score the trace that has been recorded while the acquisition is running. This prevents the user from stopping the acquisition to perform those actions. \n\nUsing this feature, the user will be able to edit an already recorded trace and perform any type of modification. The user can change the montage, sensitivity, filters and speed and among others for the view of the recording. The user will be also able to score sleep stages, mark sleep events (apneas, snoring, etc.), take measurements, record screens, select sections of the study to be cropped, insert any type of status, events, comments or notes (seizures, patient movements, etc.).\n\n\n\nIn case the studio is being recorded with video, a BWVideo Review window will be displayed with the recorded video up to the point where it has been cut.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the button  to enable the revision while recording. By default, the screen will be split with the Left side showing the recorded trace, while the Right side will be shown the live recording. A message window will appear confirming the view. \n\n\n\n\n\nTo make any changes to any of the screens, make sure that the screen to be modified is selected, identifying a red line across the channel’s name. To select the screen to be modified, click on the window you want to switch to.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe view can also be displayed in full screen view instead of split screen, which will display the recorded trace. To return to the live recording, it is required to turn off the  button. \n\n\n\nSplit Acquisition and Split Review\n\nThis feature will allow the user to divide the trace screen into two horizontal parts. On each part, different montages, speeds, sensitivities, filters, among others, can be configured. This feature is used for PSG studies in which the user can separate the monopolar channels and visualize them differently from the other bipolar sensors used in this type of study.\n\n\n\nTo enable, use the Button , located on the Tools Toolbar to enable Horizontal Live Recording Split View. This button will be available for both EEG and PSG studies.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen opening PSG studies, use the button , located on the Sleep Toolbar in order to enable Horizontal Review Recording Split View.\n\n\n\nThe default montages to be shown once the Split buttons are enabled, can be set from the Acquisition and Screen Adjustment tabs from Configurations window.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nTo make any changes to any of the screens, make sure that the screen to be modified is selected, identifying a red line across the channel’s name. To select the screen to be modified, click on the window you want to switch to.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoTo – Exam Information\n\nThe GoTo, or exam information, is opened by clicking on the button .

To introduce the variables that the software requires to display the correct data, the user can guide from the User Manual Variable, from which can be select the variables to customize the template as needed. \n\n\n\nBWAnalysis also allows us to create custom variables from new inserted events, use of mathematical operations with the pre-existing variables, and special custom graphic variables. Below you will find instructions on how to create the previously mentioned:\n\nMathematical Operations: To create equations with different types of mathematical operators, it is required to use the correct characters for each operation as well as the isolation of operations with parentheses ( ). Example: \n\nSum uses the symbol +:\n\nTotal Apneas (TST) = $#N_AP_OBSTRUCTIVE+N_AP_MIXED+N_AP_CENTRAL#$\n\n\n\nSubtraction use the symbol -:\n\nTotal Apnea (TST) = $#N_AH_RERA-N_RERA-N_HYPOPNEA#$\n\n\n\nDivision use use the symbol /:\n\nNREM Duration (in hours) = $#NREM_TIMES/60#$\n\n\n\nMultiplication use *:\n\nTotal Duration Apnea Mixed (in minutes) = $#DTOT_AP_MIXED*60#$\n\n\n\nAdvanced Equations (Order of Operation):\n\nIndexApnea (TST)= $#N_AP_OBSTRUCTIVE+N_AP_MIXED+N_AP_CENTRAL/(TST_TIME/60)#$\n\n\n\nVariables for Custom Events: To create custom events variables, it is required to identify the Event List ID and the corresponding Event ID of the desired event. From the Sleep Events tab, see item 6.18 on page 61, it can identify both as show below:\n\n\n\nEvent ID\n\nEvent List ID\n\n          ----------1 \n\n                ------2\n\n ----------------3 \n\n      -------- ----4 \n\n       ------------5 \n\n\n\n       ------------6 \n\n          ----------7 \n\n      -------------8 \n\n     --------------9\n\n\n\n\n\nDepending on the custom structure to be used, the Stage ID might be required, those IDs are shown in front of the Sleep Stage name. For example, the Sleep Stage ID for N1 is 3.\n\n\n\nSleep Stage ID\n\n\n\nThe custom variable works based on the structure below:\n\nNumber of Sleep Event:\n\n$#NUM_ES_%A_%B_%C#$ \n\nNumber of Sleep Event by Sleep Stage:\n\n$#NUM_ES_%A_%B_%F#$\n\nNumber of Sleep Event in determined Body Position:\n\n$#NUM_ES_%A_%B_%C_%D#$\n\nNumber of Sleep Event in determined Body Position:\n\n$#NUM_ES_%A_%B_%F_%D#$\n\nIndex of Sleep Event:\n\n$#INDEX_ES_%A_%B_%C#$\n\nIndex of Sleep Event by Sleep Stage:\n\n$#INDEX_ES_%A_%B_%F#$\n\nSleep Event Duration (sec.):\n\n$#T_ES_%A_%B_%C#$\n\nSleep Event Duration by Sleep Stage (sec.):\n\n$#T_ES_%A_%B_%F#$\n\nSleep Event Max Duration (sec.):\n\n$#TM_ES_%A_%B_%C#$\n\nSleep Event Max Duration by Sleep Stage (sec.):\n\n$#TM_ES_%A_%B_%F#$\n\nNumber of Sleep Events for each PAP Pressure:\n\n$#NUM_ES_%A_%B_%C_%E_PRESX#$\n\nIndex of Sleep Events for each PAP Pressure:\n\n$#IDX_ES_%A_%B_%C_%E_PRESX#$\n\n\n\nWhere: \n\n%A = 1 to 9 (Event List ID)\n\n%B = 0 to 11 (Event ID)\n\n%C = REM, NREM, VIG, TRANS, TST, TOT\n\n%D = S, P, R, L, SS, U (Position)\n\n%E = POS_TOT, POS_SUP, POS_NSUP (Simple Position)\n\n%F = S0 to S11 (Sleep Stage ID)\n\n\n\nExample:\n\nNumber of Respiratory Event number 7 in TST: \n\nUse: $#NUM_ES_%A_%B_%C#$, leave the variable as: $#NUM_ES_1_7_TST#$ \n\n\n\nNumber of Cardiac Event number 6 in TST in Supine:\n\nUse: $#NUM_ES_%A_%B_%C_%D#$, leave the variable: $#NUM_ES_4_6_TST_S#$  \n\n\n\nVariables for Custom Graphics: To add a custom graphic variable, it is required to identify the Code assigned to the custom graphic. This can be located on the bottom of the Custom Graphic once editing or creating a new one, see item 8.9.9.3 on page 144. Examples are shown below: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to fit the custom graphic in a specific space of the report, it can be used any of the size options below (This format also works for default graphics):\n\n\n\nSIZE\n\nVARIABLE STRUCTURE\n\nVARIABLE EXAMPLE\n\nStandard Size:\n\n$#CODE#$\n\n$#SAMPLE_LAYOUT#$\n\nExtra Small Size:\n\n$#<\"XS\", CODE>#$\n\n$#<\"XS\", SAMPLE_LAYOUT>#$\n\nSmall Size:\n\n$#<\"S\", CODE>#$\n\n$#<\"S\", SAMPLE_LAYOUT>#$\n\nMedium Size:\n\n$#<\"M\", CODE>#$\n\n$#<\"M\", SAMPLE_LAYOUT>#$\n\nLarge Size:\n\n$#<\"L\", CODE>#$\n\n$#<\"L\", SAMPLE_LAYOUT>#$\n\nExtra Large Size:\n\n$#<\"XL\", CODE>#$\n\n$#<\"XL\", SAMPLE_LAYOUT>#$\n\nFull Page Size\n\n$#<\"FULL\", CODE>#$\n\n$#<\"FULL\", SAMPLE_LAYOUT>#$\n\nPortrait Size:\n\n$#<\"AUTO\", CODE>#$\n\n$#<\"AUTO\", SAMPLE_LAYOUT>#$\n\n\n\nWhen finished, confirm that the personalized document is in the accepted format (.doc and .docx) and is saved on the Template folder from BWAnalysis folder (C:\\BWAnalysis\\Template).\n\n\n\nNote that all variables require the format $#XXXXXX#$, no spaces in between, if the format is not followed, the user may encounter 0 values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\tSome of the required variables might not be listed on the User Manual Variable field due customization or new implementation. If there is any special table or variable required, contact Neurovirtual Support.\n\nComparative analysis \n\nThe software allows the user to visualize several exams simultaneously, comparative analysis between two (2) or more exams. To view this comparison, open the exams to be compared, then click the Window dropdown menu and choose the desired comparison option. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerforming and Reviewing an EEG Exam\n\nTo start an EEG exam, a new study must be opened.  Select the amplifier to be used and the Exam type as EEG, even if it is a Video telemetry. \n\n\n\n Status \n\nSimilarly to Events, this tool can also allow the user to insert some \"notes\" in the trace, to be seen while revision. These \"notes\" are named Status, and they can be personalized so it facilitates their insertion.\n\n\n\nThus, actions like Awake, Hyperventilation, Photo-stimulation and other common occurrences during an EEG exam can be marked on the trace, delimiting the moment when the status presented.\n\n\n\nInserting a Status \n\nIn order to insert a status in the trace, do a right-click anywhere on the screen. A box with different options will be shown. Select the option Status and note the new menu shows all pre-defined status (personalization of the status can be done to suit the study performance). Select the desired event with a click, to insert it.\n\n\n\n\n\nStatus can be also marked from the Status Toolbar in which the default or personalized events will be listed.\n\n\n\nIn case the list of status is with the 15 available events filled out and its needed to mark another status (normally spontaneous status), click the option called Status to open the Mark general status window. Hit the Enter key from the keyboard or click the OK button to insert it in the trace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: All status marked will be available on the GoTo list.\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonalizing Status \n\nIn order to personalize the status (modify, add, delete or reorganize), click on Status on the menu and then click the option Predefined Status option. \n\n \n\n\n\nNote that a window named Predefined Status will be shown, where you can insert, move up or down an existent event, update or exclude one or all events. Keep in mind that the maximum number of status is 15, this includes status that are blank, therefore, if you want to add or modify any of the existing ones, you must first delete one or more of those that you do not want to have in the list. \n\n\n\n\n\nTo modify the name of a status, select the status from the list, then set the new name in the Status Name field and then press the Update button, changing the name of the status to the same position as the status selected.\n\n\n\nIn order to exclude a status from the list of status first of all, select the desired status and click the Delete button.\n\nIn order to update a status, select the desired status and type the updated name in the field Status’s Name, then click the Update button.\n\n\n\nThere is also the possibility of Delete all and enter only the status to be used. \n\nIt is recommended to leave between the first 5 statuses, the ones that are going to be used the most for the use of shortcuts.\n\n \n\nPhoto Stimulation\n\nTo activate the Photic Stimulation, the photo stimulator must have been previously connected to the device.  If the Photo Stimulation Toolbar is not visible, remember to enable it by clicking in the workspace free space, and select it from the dropdown menu. Note that the buttons on this bar will only be activated if the studio is in the Recording state.\n\n\n\nUse the  button to enable or disable the manual photo-stimulation.\n\nUse the button to decrease and the button to increase the frequency manually.\n\nUse the  button to decrease and the  button to increase the intensity of the light.\n\nUse the  button to enable the automatic profile for photo-stimulation. This functionality uses a protocol previously created by the photo stimulation user.\n\nIf a BWFlash kit is available (flash connected to the computer for its use), use the  button to open the BWFlash program that controls the indicated kit.\n\n\n\nHyperventilation\n\nThe hyperventilation protocol is a time when the patient is requested to do hyperventilation for a predefined period. Use the  button, located on the EEG Toolbar, to start the Hyperventilation protocol. The software has the option to set 2 different Protocols which can be selected from the same mentioned button. Note that the acquisition must be running for the button to be enabled. When started, a new Hyperventilation will be marked as a Status on the trace. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe count of the hyperventilation will start, marking an event every 5 seconds on the trace, this until the penultimate event is reached:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Hyperventilation ends, only if the pos-hyperventilation was configurated this second part of the protocol will start automatically. The P-Hyperventilation event will be marked on the trace and a count will start, marking an event every 5 seconds on the trace. To differentiate it from normal Hyperventilation, the events will be marked as PH5, PH10, PH15, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the protocol is over (with or without pos-hyperventilation) the last event will be marked on the trace as a State called End of Hyperventilation.\n\n\n\nAudio Stimulation\n\nAudio stimulation can be done with headphones or speakers. Use the button  to open the Sound Toolbar.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this bar, the user can modify the volume (how load the stim will be, the tone or pitch (how high or low, set in a Hz scale) and the frequency (how constant the stim). Once the Stimulation is started or ended, an event will be marked on the trace.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to verify that the audio system in use is functional, and the volume of the computer is turned on.\n\n\n\nDigital Analysis\n\nThe digital analysis tool allows us to visualize graphically the behavior of brain waves in periods of time chosen by the user. \n\n\n\nTo select the periods, use the button  , located on the EEG Toolbar. Locate the cursor over the trace and choose the period to analyze by doing a single click where a red rectangle with two seconds of duration will be inserted. If you want to perform the analysis of a larger section, the user must choose several consecutive periods. The user may create as many periods as necessary. Note that all periods will be listed in GoTo list, on the Period section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen two or more periods are selected, Use the button , locate on the EEG Toolbar. This will perform all the processing and analysis of the chosen sections. Then, click on the Digital Analysis dropdown menu and choose the desired analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepending on the one chosen, a new tab will appear (at the bottom of the screen) where the digital analysis will be displayed. The shown analysis can be saves, if required to include it in the report.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpectrogram\n\nFor spectrogram creation, an exam that is already recorded and completed must be opened. Use the button  , located on the EEG Toolbar to open the Layout Manager, a list of custom graphics might be displayed. To create a new Spectrogram, click on the New button, then, on the Custom Graphic window, click on the Spectrogram button. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nA new window called Spectra will be displayed, from where the settings of the Spectrogram can be set. Choose all the Active and REF electrodes for the Spectral analysis. Add or exclude as many rows as needed, using the Add and Remove buttons. From this window can also be modified the Properties (parameters) according to the user preference (including the color palette). Once the configurations are set, click on OK to add the Spectrogram to the Graphic Channels. It can be added as many Spectrograms as required.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAt the bottom left of the Custom Graphics, the name of the graphic on the Name field. Note that the Layout field will generate the code with the name assigned. This will be useful; in case you want to include it in the report. Once the name is assigned, click on the Accept button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graphic view can be configured from the Grid tab on the Custom Graphic configurations. From there, it can be selected how to see the Type and Color of Grid, to show or not the Borders of the graphic, the position of the Channels. Most of the configurations will be displayed on the Software as well as on the Generated Report if the graphic is added.\n\n \n\nThe initial window will be displayed, already with the new custom graphic created.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the layout manager window can Edit, Add or Remove any additional Spectrogram required. To run the spectrogram, double-click on the spectrogram created. A new tab will appear (at the button of the screen) where the graphic will be displayed.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThe spectrogram graphics can also be opened on the same screen as the trace. In order to do this, locate the cursor anywhere on the trace, right click and select the Tile Horizontal option. Then, from the menu select the graphic to be displayed. If selected Tile Vertical, the screen will be split vertically between the Graphic and the trace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrends\n\nFor Trend (Amplitude Analysis) creation, an exam that is already recorded and completed must be opened. Use the button  , located on the EEG Toolbar to open the Layout Manager, a list of custom graphics might be displayed. In order to create a new Trend, click on the New button, then, on the Custom Graphic window, click on the Trend button. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nA new window called aEEG will display, from where the settings of the Trend can be set. Choose the channels to be compared (only two channels or hemispheres), the type of amplitude assigned (minimum, maximum, average, percentage, among others) and the color for each analysis. Once the configurations are set, click on OK to add the Trend to the Graphic Channels. It can be added as many Trends as required.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the bottom left of the Custom Graphics, the name of the graphic on the Name filed. Note that the Layout field will generate the code with the name assigned. This will be useful; in case you want to include it in the report. Once the name is assigned, click on the Accept button.\n\n\n\nThe graphic view can be configured from the Grid tab on the Custom Graphic configurations. From there, if can be selected how to see the Type and Color of Grid, to show or not the Borders of the graphic, the position of the Channels. Most of the configurations will be displayed on the Software as well as on the Generated Report if the graphic is added. The initial window will be displayed, already with the new custom graphic created.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the layout manager window can Edit, Add or Remove any additional Trends required. To run the spectrogram, double-click on the Trend created. A new tab will appear (at the button of the screen) where the graphics will be displayed.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThe Trend graphics can also be opened on the same screen as the trace. In order to do this, locate the cursor anywhere on the trace, right click and select the Tile Horizontal option. Then, from the menu select the graphic to be displayed. If selected Tile Vertical, the screen will be split vertically between the Graphic and the trace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerforming and reviewing a PSG Exam\n\nThere are tools that are used only to perform PSG exams. In basal exams, default or custom montages are used. However, for other exams such as Split, PAP and MSLT, different tools must be used. For any of these exams, scoring of Sleep Stages, Sleep Events and any other marking or insertion can be done while the acquisition is running or after the exam is finished.\n\n\n\nSpecial Study Type\n\nWhen creating a PSG exam, it can be recorded as a Diagnose (Basal or parasomnia) study, as a Titration (use of PAP device) study, as a Split Night (diagnose + titration) study or as a MSLT/MWT study.\n\n\n\nTitration\n\nWhen performing a Titration exam, the values required to be displayed in the trace must be configured on the DC channels. The most common variables are single CPAP, Bilevel (IPAP, EPAP), ASV and Flow (trace). If these values are automatically entered into the trace, the EPAP must be enabled for recording. Use the  button, located on the PSG Toolbar, so that the EPAP values are visible.\n\n\n\n\n\nSplit Night\n\nWhen performing a Split Night exam, the diagnosis part of the exam is conducted as normal. When identified, the titration system is set to the patient and the indicators must be enabled. Use the  button to start the treatment section and use the  button to finish the treatment section. In case its required to delete the Split marked, use the button  or refer to Exam Information (GoTo) and delete the Splits that appear in the list. If the position of the Splits is needed to be checked, use the  button to move between the events marked.\n\n\n\nMSLT/MWT\n\nWhen performing an MSLT or a MWT exam, as there are several naps, it is necessary that for the correct analysis of the data shown in the report. Confirm that the MSLT or MWT checkbox found in the Patient Information window is checked.\n\n\n\nTurning the Lights On and Off\n\nWhile the exam is being recorded or after it’s recorded, it is recommended to mark the lights off and lights on to delimit the recording of the study for its processing.\n\n\n\nThe Button  is used to mark the moment when the record room lights were turned off. The lights off can be also marked by clicking on the Sleep dropdown menu, select the Lights Off option.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Button  is used to mark the moment when the record room lights were turned on. The lights on can be also marked by clicking on the Sleep dropdown menu, select the Lights On option.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that for MSLT or MWT exams, multiple pairs of light events will be needed (4 to 5 lights off and 4 to 5 lights on). This process will be successfully done if the MSLT/MWT checkbox is marked on the Patient Information.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a Split Night exam is recorded, it can be marked in two different ways:\n\nMark a single event of lights off and a single event of lights on, using the button  to mark the beginning of the treatment section (when applying the titration to the patient.\n\n\n\nMark as many pairs of lights as needed when the treatment section of the study is required to be limited. Example: When the user requires a Split Night but can’t tolerate the treatment, the user needs to use the  button to start the treatment section and use the  button to finish the treatment section (highlight). Between those events, the lights off and lights on needed to be applied, as well as the other two sections where the treatment was not used.\n\n \n\n\n\nManual Value Insertion\n\nIt is possible that, for various reasons, some values that are automatically detected, such as the position (with the position sensor), the oxygen saturation (with the oximeter sensor), the titration values (with the synchronized CPAP), among others, do not adequately detect the values due to failure or damage in the devices or connections. For this reason, the software allows the manual entry of the values.\n\n\n\nPosition \n\nUse the  button to manually set the position where the patient is. After this position is selected, it is necessary to click OK to confirm the insertion. If it is activated in an exam in progress, the checkbox should be selected to allow the manual insertion, and the position will remain as the last one selected until the window is opened again and changed the selection of position. When the change is made in an exam already recorded and finished, the user must enter the start and end epochs for the position to be chosen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPAP\n\nUse the  button to manually set the titration pressure values used. After CPAP/IPAP, EPAP and Backup Rate (if apply) are set, it is necessary to click OK confirm the insertion. When the manual insert is done, the values will be displayed on each of the DC Channels previously configurated. Note that when a change is made in an exam already recorded and finished, the user must enter the start and end epochs for the titration values to be added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASV\n\nUse the  button to manually set the ASV titration mode values used. Select the Profile to be used. After all required fields are set, it is necessary to click OK confirm the insertion. When the manual insert is done, the values will be displayed on the DC where IPAP/ASV DC Type was set.\n\n\n\nThe user can insert up to 16 values under the ASV Profile selected. Use the dropdown menu from the top right to change between the profiles to accommodate the procedure or variables required for each patient. Note that when a change is made in an exam already recorded and finished, the user must enter the start and end epochs for the titration values to be added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nOxygen \n\nUse the  button to manually set the Oxygen applied to the patient’s treatment. After this value is set, it is necessary to click OK confirm the insertion. If it is activated in an exam in progress, the checkbox should be selected to allow the manual insertion, and the value will remain as the last one selected until the window is opened again and changed the selection of oxygen. When the change is made in an exam already recorded and finished, the user must enter the start and end epochs for the oxygen to be added.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nSaturation and Heart Rate\n\nUse the   button to manually set the Saturation values presented by the patient. After this value is set, it is necessary to click OK to confirm the insertion. Use the  button to manually set the Heart Rate values presented by the patient. After this value is set, it is necessary to click OK to confirm the insertion. If it is activated in an exam in progress, the checkbox should be selected to allow the manual insertion, and the value will remain as the last one selected until the window is opened again and changed the selection of value. When the change is made in an exam already recorded and finished, the user must enter the start and end epochs for the value to be added.\n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\nSleep Stage\n\nIn order to score the Sleep Stages, the user can use the numeric keypad from the keyboard or through the Sleep dropdown menu on the Label the Sleep Stage option.\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\nSleep Events\n\nIn order to insert a sleep event on the trace, identify the event you want to mark then click on the beginning of the desired area and drag to the end. If the event type needs to be changed, do a right-click on it and select the event type.\n\n\n\n       \n\n\n\nRemember that:\n\nEvents can be deleted by placing the cursor over the event and pressing the delete key on the keyboard. \n\nEvents can be changed by placing the cursor over the event and pressing the keys that were set as shortcuts. Example. Change to Obstructive Apnea with the O key.\n\nThe duration of each event can be modified by clicking and dragging from the corner of the already marked event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach channel in the montage can have an event subtype assigned to it, to score the same event each time. To do this, double-click on the name of the channel and modify on the Stage tab the assign subtype event in the dropdown menu.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssistant Scoring\n\nThe Assistant Scoring feature will help the user on the scoring of the study, by analyzing the recording, and automatically detect and marked Sleep Events and Sleep Stages along the trace. Use the  button, located on the PSG Toolbar, to start this feature. The window can also be opened by opening the Sleep dropdown menu and selecting the Automatic Assistant Detection Tool option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll assistant detections marked can be identified on the GoTo from the Comment column, those will be marked as *Assist – Info.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe user can set the feature to run automatically once it’s opened. To enable this, click on the Configurations button from the main feature window, then on the General tab, select the desired detections to be run when opening any study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf other detections are used, it is needed to set review the detection set up first. On the Configurations window, click on the tab from the required detection and adjust any of the detection parameters necessary. Example, on the Respiratory detection, it is needed to add the channels for each RespEvent to be scored, as well as its detection parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe assisted scoring feature provided in this software is intended solely as an assistive tool to support healthcare professionals in the analysis and interpretation of sleep-related data. It is not designed to replace or substitute the clinical judgment, diagnosis, or treatment decisions of a qualified physician or healthcare provider.\n\n\n\nThis feature is not intended to be used independently by individuals without the supervision, review, and approval of a licensed healthcare professional. Users are expressly advised that all data, results, and reports generated by this feature must be evaluated and validated by a qualified medical professional before any medical conclusions or treatment decisions are made.\n\n\n\nThe developers and distributors of this software accept no responsibility or liability for any clinical decision or action taken based on the use of this feature without proper medical oversight. The assisted scoring feature should be used in conjunction with a full clinical evaluation, including but not limited to diagnostic assessments performed by a healthcare professional.\n\n\n\nBy using this software, you acknowledge and agree that the responsibility for the interpretation of any assisted scoring data and the subsequent medical decisions remains solely with the healthcare provider, and any risks associated with the improper use of this feature are assumed by the user.\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistics\n\nWhen scoring is being done, while recording or scoring, a preview of the information that will be shown in the report can be displayed, use the button  button, located on the PSG Toolbar to open the Statistics window. From this pop-up window, the user can visualize not only the durations of the sleep stages and efficiency but also the different sleep events main information in REM, NREM, TST and TIB, this information can be displayed in both the Diagnoses and Split Night (if apply). \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAlthough the user can configure these visualizations. To do this, click on the last tab, Configurations, then select the one that will need to be adjusted or create a new one. Use the buttons from the right to edit the Statistics view as required.\n\n\n\nNote that any change made requires the software to be close and reopen to be visualized.\n\n\n\nScoring Set and Interscore\n\nThe Interscore feature is a tool that allows the comparison of different scorings done from different users to the same exam, without modifying the other scorings. The results are displayed on a Report that shows the difference between the score of each of the users and the main score, called Golden Score. Before using the feature, make sure that the users have been created on the User Account tab from Configurations window. \n\n\n\nIn order to use this feature, use the button to open the Open File window. Locate the desired study to be analyzed from the list, then select it by checking the box on the Select column. Before opening the study, check the Open with Inter-Score option located at the bottom of the window, then click OK to open the study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the Inter-Score Login window, select the user that will be scoring the study. Click on the OK button to access, then score the exam as normal. \n\n\n\n\n\nIf the software is closed, the user will not be able to access again to modify the scoring, avoiding malicious or modifications from other users before the Interscore as processed.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that at least 2 users must score the study for the comparative to work as expected. When all users have scored the study, it is required to access with the Golden Scorer user (use the default password \"sleep2010\" to access). This user is recommended to use as the main Golden scorer but it is not mandatory. The access with this user is done only for the generation of the Interscore report. \n\n\n\nTo generate the Interscore Report, use the  button, located on the PSG Toolbar. This will open the Inter-score Report Tech Selection window. From there, select the main Golden score user as GOLDEN column, then select other scores to be analyzed on the Select column. Example: \n\nGOLDEN SCORER as main GOLDEN scoring vs jsmith is the main GOLDEN scoring.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAfter selecting the users as required, click on Generate button to generate the comparative report.\n\n\n\nGraphics\n\nHypnogram\n\nIn order to generate the Hypnogram graphic to be seen at all times \n\non the screen, click the View dropdown menu, then select the Hypnogram and SPO2 Toolbar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault PSG Graphics\n\nThe software can generate different graphics that will reflect the trace of a specific channel, the trace of a numeric channel or the sleep event marked within a trace.\n\n\n\nIn order to open the default graphics, click the Sleep dropdown menu, then select any of the default graphics listed. Those graphics can be generated as they are shown in the Reports.\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom PSG Graphics\n\nThe user can also personalize the graphics to suit their requirements. In order to open a graphic, use the button  , located on the PSG Toolbar or Sleep Toolbar, depending on the study type opened. The Layout Manager window will appear with the list of Graphics created. The user can also open this window by clicking on the Sleep dropdown menu, then selecting the Custom Graphic. The first option will open the Layout Manager, the other options on the list are the custom graphics listed on the Manager.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n\n\n\nIn order to exclude a graphic from the list of layouts, select the desired graphic and click the Delete button. \n\n\n\nIn order to edit a graphic, select the desired graphic and click the Edit button. The user can also create a new graphic. Click on the New button. \n\n\n\nWhen using the Edit or New button, the Custom Graphic properties window will appear, showing a list on the left with the different channels that can be selected. To add on the channels, click on the desired channel, then click on the Add button. The same way you can remove the not desired channel by selecting the channel on the right and clicking on the Remove button. From this window, you can edit the position of the channels with the Move Up and Move Down buttons, as well as assign a specific event to be displayed on the graphic list.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the options Spectrogram and Trend will be available for PSG, those can be configurated but will process only the EEG signals, for more information of this configuration, check Custom EEG Graphics section.\n\n\n\nThe graphic view can be configured from the Grid tab on the Custom Graphic configurations. From there, if can be selected how to see the Type and Color of Grid, to show or not the Borders of the graphic, the position of the Channels, enable the Ruler with a certain speed and if enable the TIB or not. Most of the configurations will be displayed on the Software as well as on the Generated Report if the graphic is added. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nDepending on the one chosen, a new tab will appear (at the bottom of the screen) where the graphics will be displayed.\n\n\n\nThe custom graphics can also be opened on the same screen as the trace. To do this, locate the cursor anywhere on the trace, right click and select the Tile Horizontal option. Then, from the menu select the graphic to be displayed. If selected Tile Vertical, the screen will be split vertically between the Graphic and the trace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblems and Possible Solutions\n\n\n\nNew exam option blocked\n\nIf the software may not allow to create a new exam, it might be because the license is limited according to the purchase agreement. The permanent license will be provided under the commercial agreement. In the meantime, a periodic license might be provided. \n\n\n\nIf the new exam icon is disabled, the user should contact technical support to request update of the license key. The user must provide the serial number of the equipment in use, the type of exams that are performed and informed if the camera is going to be used. \n\n\n\n\n\nWith the information mentioned, the customer support engineer will provide an Activation Key and the icon will be active again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMerging Studies\n\nTo merge two exams, the user should follow the steps:\n\nOpen the Open window where all recorded studies will be listed. \n\nSelect from the checkbox the files to be merged.\n\nVerify that the selected files have the same patient name, were recorded on the same amplifier and are from the same type of study recorded. \n\nClick on the Merge Studies button\n\nThe resulting file will be saved in the Edit folder set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the software version in use is older than version 1.99, make sure that the studies are in order (date-wise). If it is a higher version, the software will detect and sort the exams automatically.\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Issues\n\nExam videos are saved inside the Videos folder inside the patient's exam folder. If there are no files inside this folder, the exam was recorded without video.\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo not displayed after recording\n\nIf videos are not showing even when the files can be seen on the Videos folder, it might be due to the Time format of the computer where the study was created (AM/PM correct ones). If the format was recorded as a. m. / p. m., it can cause problems in the display of the video when it is open for reading. The video window might be seen completely grayed out or show a message informing them there are no recorded videos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is recommended to change the settings of the computer to apply the correct Date and Time format to accomplish the video file name format as:\n\nLastName.FirstName.MM-DD-YYYY HH.MM.SS AM/PM(YYYY-MM-DD HH.MM.SS.mms)\n\n\n\nDATE FORMAT\n\nTIME FORMAT\n\nMM= Month\n\nHH= Time at which recording began\n\nDD= Day\n\nMM= Minute in which recording began \n\nYYYY= Year\n\nSS= Second in which recording began\n\n\n\nmmm= Millisecond in which recording began\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nBlack, Blue or Color bars in BWVideo view\n\n\n\nThe most frequent problem regarding video is the disconnecting of the camera. When using an analog camera and this gets disconnected, the Video image shows as a blue or black screen. \n\n\n\n\n\nAlways verify that the camera is connected to the power outlet and the physical connections are adjusted before checking the software options.\n\n\n\nFor analog cameras, cameras that work with video capture devices (Dazzle, Diamond, EasyCap, etc.) and cameras that connect to the computer via USB Type-A connection, always select Video Device tab from Video Information 1, then verify the desired camera in the drop-down menu to be chosen. If the software doesn't detect the camera, choose another available one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen using an IP camera and this doesn’t get identified, the Video image shows as a color bars screen. \n\n\n\n\n\nFor IP cameras, that are normally connected via network cable directly to the computer or network switch. Always select IP Camera tab from Video Information 1, then check the IP set on the URL as well as the credentials (Username and Password). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf any of the options were changed for its correction, remember to restart the BWVideo for the changes to be saved and visible. To do this, the user can stop the acquisition and start it again, or you can completely close the BWAnalysis, then reopen it. \n\n\n\nTransparent Video\n\nThe video window has the option of turning a little transparent to view the trace without stopping the recording. This can be done during the acquisition or revision of the exam. \n\n        \n\nTo turn it ON or OFF, simply select the video window, then press the SHIFT key from the keyboard.\n\n\n\nDate and Time label missing\n\nThe video may not have the date and time label visible. If the video was recorded without it, there is no way to place it later, however, for new videos it is possible to enable it. To do this, click on the gear icon that is located at the lower left corner of the video window, then click on the Misc tab.\n\nFrom this tab, check the box Enable on the Time section. From there the user can configure the color, size and position of the Date and Time label. By default, the font will be red and small and will be in the upper right corner. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnabled box not checked\n\n\n\nEnabled box checked\n\n\n\nVideo with Zoom\n\nIt happens when the pointer is positioned over the video image and the mouse scroll is moved. To remove it, simply move down the scroll and move the cursor out of the video window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tAny perception or suspicion of abnormal functioning, we recommend the operator to immediately get in touch with Neurovirtual Customer Support for verification.",

Scoring Manual Version 2.3 \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nPreface \n\"We're moving to this integration of biomedicine, information technology, \nwireless and mobile now - an era of digital medicine. Even my stethoscope is \nnow digital. And of course, there's an app for that.\" \n \n- Daniel Kraft, physician-scientist, inventor \n \n \n \n \nThe publication of The AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events \nin 2007 was a landmark event and the culmination of thousands of hours of hard work \nby many dedicated individuals. The 2007 manual resulted in standardization of sleep \nmonitoring techniques and scoring, improving uniformity and reliability in the diagnosis \nand treatment of sleep disorders across different sleep centers. Nonetheless, advances in \nsleep monitoring technology and questions concerning interpretation of the 2007 rules \nform the basis of an initiative put forth by the AASM Board of Directors to once again \nupdate this critical document in sleep medicine. \nAt the same time, there has been an explosion of digital information technology and \ndevices that has shifted publication of nearly all documents away from the printed page. \nThis trend toward a digital format has been accelerated by the conveniences of \npublishing online, most notably, accessibility at any location using smartphones, tablets \nand computers. \nGiven the need to update the 2007 Scoring Manual and address a changed digital \ninformation landscape, the Board of Directors of the AASM mandated that the scoring \nmanual be published online with regular updates as necessary. A Scoring Manual \nCommittee was established to oversee the content and to make recommendations when \ncontent changes are indicated, need for clarification exists, there is new technology or \nthe literature suggests that updates are needed. The major goals for this initial revision \nof the scoring manual included conversion to a Web-based format, standardization of \nstructure and terminology, inclusion of material covered in the scoring manual FAQs \nfrom the AASM website, and updated figures as necessary. In addition, the committee \nwas tasked with incorporating new rules for scoring respiratory events that resulted \nfrom the work of the Sleep Apnea Definitions Task Force. \nIn true digital format, the first online version of The AASM Scoring Manual for Sleep \nand Associated Events was called Version 2.0. Electronic links quickly take the reader \nto notes and areas of interest. The scoring manual is accessible not just on the computer, \nbut also on the flexible viewing styles of mobile technology. Version 2.0 represented \nthe first step in resolving issues and ambiguities in the scoring of sleep and associated \nevents. This manual is an incremental work in progress, guided by feedback from the \nmembership and the Board of Directors, which will continue through annual updates. It \nis the hope of the Scoring Manual Committee that the online manual will continue to \nadvance the field of sleep medicine and improve the quality of care for patients with \nsleep disorders. \n \n \n \n \n\n2012-2013 AASM Scoring Manual Committee: \nRichard B.

User Guide \nOrganization of the Manual \nThe AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events is designed to guide \nusers through the technical aspects of conducting routine polysomnography (PSG) \ntesting as well as the analytic scoring and interpretation of PSG results. The rules for \nPSG testing and scoring are divided over seven chapters (II-VIII) of the manual. \nChapter II specifies all of the parameters that should be reported in a routine PSG test. \nChapter III details the digital and filter settings that are recommended for routine PSG \nrecording. Chapters IV-VIII provide additional technical specifications as well as \nscoring rules for the major categories of testing: sleep staging, arousal, cardiac, \nmovement, and respiratory. Chapter IX provides technical specifications and scoring \nrules for home sleep apnea testing including those utilizing respiratory flow and/or \neffort and those utilizing peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT). Chapter X (Development \nProcess) details the process by which the rules were developed. An outline of the \nevidence level and decision-making process for each rule may be found in chapter XI \n(Procedural Notes). Lastly, chapter XII is a glossary of the terminology used throughout \nthe manual. \nWhile the rules in most chapters apply to patients of all ages, rules for adult and \npediatric populations are separated in chapters IV (Sleep Staging Rules) and VIII \n(Respiratory Rules) due to critical age-specific differences in testing and scoring. \nThe rules within each chapter are organized into categories designated by an upper case \nletter. The rules themselves are numbered and may have several components that are \nidentified by lower case letters. \nIN EACH SECTION, ALONG WITH THE RULES, YOU WILL NOTICE: \nThe type of rule: \n \nThese rules are recommended for the routine scoring of in-lab \npolysomnography or home sleep apnea testing. \n \nThese are rules that may be used as alternatives to the recommended \nrules at the discretion of the clinician or investigator. \n \nThese are suggested rules for uncommonly encountered events, events \nnot known to have physiologic significance or events for which there \nwas no consensus decision. Scoring may be performed at the \ndiscretion of the clinician or investigator.\n \nNotes: If applicable, notes are positioned at the end of a category in order to provide \nadditional information that is critical for carrying out the rules. Rules are followed by \nsuperscripts that signify the corresponding note (ex.\nN1,N2\n). \nSleep Facility Accreditation \nAASM sleep facility accreditation requires compliance with all of the rules, definitions, \nand notes in this manual. According to the AASM, rules specified to be recommended, \nacceptable, or optional are all acceptable methods for scoring. Based on the discretion \nof the clinician or investigator, a specific center or laboratory may use the acceptable \nrule in place of the recommended rule without any risk to accreditation. Optional rules \nmay be followed in addition to the recommended and acceptable rules without any risk \nto accreditation.

In the absence of clear preferences, use similar settings among leads to simplify \ntechnical implementation. \n \nNote 2. This applies to measured EEG and EOG electrode impedance. Electrode \nimpedances should be rechecked during a recording when any pattern that might be \nartifactual appears. \n \nNote 3. For EEG, 500 Hz sampling rate could improve resolution of spikes in the EEG \nand better maintain details of the waveform. \n \nNote 4. For more detailed EEG analysis, sampling rate and high-frequency filter \nsettings may be increased. In these circumstances, the sampling rate should be at least 3 \ntimes the high-frequency filter settings. \n\n \nNote 5. For EOG, using the 500 Hz desirable EEG sampling rate also allows the \nreflection of the EEG in this lead as an EEG backup and may better define some \nartifacts in these leads. \n \nNote 6. This applies to submental and leg EMG. Higher sampling rates better define \nwaveforms; while the waveform itself is not an issue, a better-defined waveform can \nhelp avoid amplitude attenuation as the envelope of the rapidly oscillating signal is \ninterpreted. \n \nNote 7. For ECG, 500 Hz sampling rate can better define pacemaker spikes and ECG \nwaveforms, however, pacemaker spikes can be seen at 200 Hz, and the evaluation of \ncardiac ischemia by ECG waveform is not a common PSG issue. Higher frequencies \nmay be required for complex waveform analysis and research applications. \n \nNote 8. For oximetry, 25 Hz sampling is desirable to assist with artifact evaluation. \n \nNote 9. For nasal pressure transducer technology (especially with settings which \nidentify snoring occurring on top of the airflow waveform), this higher frequency may \nbe of benefit for better definition of flattening, plateauing, and/or fluttering in the \nairflow waveform. \n \nNote 10. The body position channel is exempt from the digital resolution standard. \nHowever, the recommended sampling rate of 1 Hz remains in effect. \n \nNote 11. For snoring sound, 500 Hz sampling rate can better define amplitude variation \nby clearer waveforms with more accurate amplitude determination as the envelope of \nthe rapidly oscillating signal is interpreted, (as for EMG). If a preprocessing of snoring \nresults in a continuous sound loudness level or in a sound intensity level, then a much \nlower sampling rate is acceptable. That sampling rate is not specified because it depends \non the preprocessing of the sound in order to produce loudness. \n \nNote 12. For rib cage and abdominal movements using inductance plethysmography, \ncardiogenic oscillations can be better seen and may result in better artifact assessment at \na higher sampling rate. \n \nNote 13. To accommodate older equipment, filter settings in the range of 30-35 Hz may \nbe used to comply with the recommendations of 35 Hz. This applies most specifically in \nthe context of EEG and EOG high filter settings. \n \nNote 14. For ECG, low-frequency settings and wide bandwidth minimizes distortion in \na 12 lead ECG; however in PSG recording with single-channel modified lead II used for \nidentifying basic heart rates and dysrhythmias, it may not be as necessary. Advanced \ncardiac assessment may be more optimal using a low-frequency filter of 0.3 Hz for \nslower parts of the cardiac cycle. The channel is susceptible to artifacts at this setting \ndue to patient movement, perspiration, muscle activity and electrode displacement. \nArtifact is less likely at these settings when standard ECG leads are used for cardiac \nmonitoring. \n \n \n \n\nB.

Fz-Cz is not appropriate for measuring the amplitude of frontal activity for \ndetermination of slow wave activity. When using the acceptableEEG derivations and \nthe acceptable EOG derivations (Figure 2), the E1-Fpz derivation should be used to \nmeasure frontal slow wave amplitude. Used in this way, Fpz will be the active electrode \nrecording frontal activity and E1 the reference electrode in a referential derivation. \nWhen using theacceptable EEG derivations and the recommended EOG derivations, \nEEG amplitude to determine slow wave activity should be measured using the C4-M1 \nderivation (C3-M2 if either C4 or M1 electrodes malfunction).

The following terminology should be used for the stages of sleep in \nadults:   \na. Stage W (Wakefulness) \nb. Stage N1 (NREM 1) \nc. Stage N2 (NREM 2) \nd. Stage N3 (NREM 3) \ne. Stage R (REM) \n2. Score epochs using the following parameters:  \na. Score sleep stages in 30-second, sequential epochs commencing at \nthe start of the study. \nb. Assign a stage to each epoch. \nc. If two or more stages coexist during a single epoch, assign the \nstage comprising the greatest portion of the epoch. \nd. When three or more segments of an epoch meet criteria for \ndifferent stages (stage W, N1, N2, N3, R): \ni. Score the epoch as sleep if the majority of the epoch meets criteria for stage \nN1, N2, N3, or R. \nii. Assign the sleep stage that occurs for the majority of sleep within the epoch. \n(see Figure 4) \n3. Score in accordance with the following definitions for EEG \nfrequencies:  \na. Slow wave activity: frequency of 0.5-2.0 Hz and minimum \namplitude of 75 μV peak to peak in frontal derivations \nb. Delta waves are 0-3.99 Hz \nc. Theta waves are 4-7.99 Hz \nd. Alpha waves are 8-13 Hz \ne. Beta waves are greater than 13 Hz \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \nE. Scoring Stage W\nN1\n,\nN2\n,\nN3\n,\nN4\n,\nN5\n \n1. Score in accordance with the following definitions:   \nAlpha rhythm (posterior dominant rhythm in adults and older children): An \nEEG pattern consisting of trains of sinusoidal 8-13 Hz activity recorded over \nthe occipital region with eye closure and attenuating with eye opening. \nEye blinks: Conjugate vertical eye movements at a frequency of 0.5-2 Hz present \nin wakefulness with the eyes open or closed. \nReading eye movements: Trains of conjugate eye movements consisting of a \nslow phase followed by a rapid phase in the opposite direction as the \nindividual reads. \nRapid eye movements (REMs): Eye movements recorded in the EOG \nderivations consisting of conjugate, irregular, sharply peaked eye movements \nwith an initial deflection usually lasting <500 msec. While rapid eye \nmovements are characteristic of stage R sleep, they may also be seen in \nwakefulness with eyes open when individuals visually scan the environment. \nSlow eye movements (SEM): Conjugate, reasonably regular, sinusoidal eye \nmovements with an initial deflection that usually lasts >500 msec. Slow eye \nmovements may be seen during eyes closed wake and stage N1. \n2. Score epochs as stage W when more than 50% of the epoch \ncontains EITHER 2a or 2b or BOTH: (see Figure 5)   \na. Alpha rhythm (posterior dominant rhythm) over the occipital \nregion (individuals generating alpha rhythm with eye closure) \nb. Other findings consistent with stage W (all individuals) \ni. Eye blinks (0.5 to 2 Hz) \nii. Rapid eye movements associated with normal or high chin muscle tone \niii. Reading eye movements   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nNote 1. Stage W represents the waking state, ranging from full alertness through early \nstages of drowsiness. Electrophysiological and psychophysiological markers of \ndrowsiness may be present during stage W and may persist into stage N1. \n \nNote 2. In stage W, the majority of individuals with eyes closed will demonstrate alpha \nrhythm (posterior dominant rhythm). The EEG pattern with eyes open consists of low-\namplitude activity (chiefly beta and alpha frequencies) without the rhythmicity of alpha \nrhythm. About 10% of individuals do not generate an alpha rhythm upon eye closure, \nand a further 10% may generate a limited alpha rhythm. In these individuals, the \noccipital EEG activity is similar during eye opening and eye closure. \n \nNote 3. The EOG during wakefulness may demonstrate rapid eye blinks at a frequency \nof about 0.5-2 Hz. The earliest sign of drowsiness is the absence of eye blinks. As \ndrowsiness develops, slow eye movements may develop, even in the presence of \ncontinued posterior dominant rhythm. If the eyes are open, voluntary rapid eye \nmovements or reading eye movements may be seen. \n \nNote 4. The chin EMG during stage W is of variable amplitude but is usually higher \nthan during sleep stages. \n \nNote 5. Time with the patient disconnected from the recording equipment should be \nscored as stage W. Brief episodes of sleep during this time, if they occur, are not \nconsidered significant for the stage scoring summary. \n \n \nF. Scoring Stage N1 \n1. Score in accordance with the following definitions:   \nSlow eye movements (SEM): Conjugate, reasonably regular, sinusoidal eye \nmovements with an initial deflection that usually lasts >500 msec. Slow eye \nmovements may be seen during eyes closed wake and stage N1. \nLow-amplitude, mixed-frequency EEG activity: Low-amplitude, \npredominantly 4-7 Hz activity. \nVertex sharp waves (V waves): Sharply contoured waves with duration <0.5 \nseconds (as measured at the base of the wave), maximal over the central region \nand distinguishable from the background activity. They are most often seen \nduring transition to stage N1 sleep but can occur in either stage N1 or N2 \nsleep. These waveforms typically first appear at 4-6 months post-term. \nSleep onset: The start of the first epoch scored as any stage other than stage W. \n(In most subjects this will usually be the first epoch of stage N1.) \n\n2. In individuals who generate alpha rhythm, score stage N1 if the \nalpha rhythm is attenuated and replaced by low-amplitude, \nmixed-frequency activity for more than 50% of the \nepoch.\nN1\n,\nN2\n,\nN3\n   \n3. In individuals who do not generate alpha rhythm, score stage N1 \ncommencing with the earliest of ANY of the following \nphenomena:\nN1\n,\nN2\n,\nN3\n,\nN4\n,\nN5\n   \na. EEG activity in range of 4-7 Hz with slowing of background \nfrequencies by ≥1 Hz from those of stage W \nb. Vertex sharp waves \nc. Slow eye movements \n4. An epoch is scored as stage N1 if the majority of the epoch meets \nthe criteria for stage N1 (EEG showing LAMF EEG activity) in \nthe absence of evidence for another sleep stage. Subsequent \nepochs with an EEG showing LAMF EEG activity are scored as \nstage N1 until there is evidence for another sleep stage (usually \nstage W, stage N2 or stage R). (see Figure 6)   \n \n5. When an arousal interrupts stage N2 sleep, score subsequent \nsegments of the recording as stage N1 if the EEG exhibits low-\namplitude, mixed-frequency activity without one or more K \ncomplexes and/or sleep spindles until there is evidence for another \nstage of sleep (see G. Scoring Stage N2).   \n6. When an arousal interrupts stage R sleep and is followed by a \nlow-amplitude, mixed-frequency EEG without posterior \ndominant rhythm AND with slow eye movements, score the \n\nsegments of the record containing the eye movements as stage N1 \neven if the chin EMG activity remains low (at the stage R level). \nContinue to score stage N1 until there is evidence for another \nstage of sleep, usually stage N2 (see G.2) or stage R (see I.2 and \nI.3).   \nNote 1. Vertex sharp waves may be present but are not required for scoring stage N1. \n \nNote 2. The EOG will often show slow eye movements in stage N1, but these are not \nrequired for scoring. \n \nNote 3. During stage N1, the chin EMG amplitude is variable, but often lower than in \nstage W. \n \nNote 4. As slow eye movements often commence before attenuation of alpha rhythm, \nsleep latency may be slightly shorter for some individuals who do not generate alpha \nrhythm compared to those who do. \n \nNote 5. Theta frequency (4-7 Hz) waveforms that are of pathological origin (such as \nthose resulting from neurological impairment, encephalopathy or epilepsy) should not \nbe considered toward the determination of Stage N1 sleep. In a person with a slow \nbackground EEG in the awake state, further non-pathological slowing of the \nbackground activity of >1 Hz from that seen in the wake state would be considered \nevidence of Stage N1 sleep. \n \nG. Scoring Stage N2 \n1. Score in accordance with the following definitions:   \nK complex: A well-delineated, negative, sharp wave immediately followed by a \npositive component standing out from the background EEG, with total \nduration ≥0.5 seconds, usually maximal in amplitude when recorded using \nfrontal derivations. For an arousal to be associated with a K complex, the \narousal must either be concurrent with the K complex or commence no more \nthan 1 second after termination of the K complex. (see V. Arousal Rule) \nSleep spindle: A train of distinct waves with frequency 11-16 Hz (most \ncommonly 12-14 Hz) with a duration ≥0.5 seconds, usually maximal in \namplitude in the central derivations. \n\n2. Begin scoring stage N2 (in absence of criteria for N3) if EITHER \nor BOTH of the following occur during the first half of that epoch \nor the last half of the previous epoch:\nN1\n,\nN2\n,\nN3\n,\nN4\n   \na. One or more K complexes unassociated with arousals \nb. One or more sleep spindles \n3. Score a given epoch as stage N2 if the majority of the epoch meets \ncriteria for stage N2. If the waveforms in rule G.2.a or G.2.b are \nfollowed by an arousal in the same or subsequent epoch (see \nFigure 7), the segment of the recording preceding the arousal is \nconsidered stage N2 (see rule G.6.b).\nN1\n,\nN5\n   \n \n\n4. Continue to score epochs with low-amplitude, mixed-frequency \nEEG activity without K complexes or sleep spindles as stage N2 if \nthey are preceded by epochs containing EITHER of the following \nand there is no intervening arousal:   \na. K complexes unassociated with arousals \nb. Sleep spindles \n5. Epochs following an epoch of stage N3 that do not meet criteria \nfor stage N3 are scored as stage N2 if there is no intervening \narousal and the epoch does not meet criteria for stage W or stage \nR. (see Figure 8)   \n \n\n6. End scoring stage N2 sleep when ONE of the following events \noccurs:\nN6\n,\nN7\n   \na. Transition to stage W \nb. An arousal followed by low-amplitude, mixed-frequency EEG \n(change to stage N1 until a K complex unassociated with an arousal \nor a sleep spindle occurs) (see Figure 7). This assumes that the \nepoch does not meet criteria for stage R (rule I.3) (see Figure \n11C). \nc. A major body movement followed by slow eye movements and \nlow-amplitude, mixed-frequency EEG without non-arousal \nassociated K complexes or sleep spindles (score the epoch \nfollowing the major body movement as stage N1; score the epoch \nas stage N2 if there are no slow eye movements; the epoch \ncontaining the body movement is scored using the major body \nmovement rules under section J) (see Figure 9) \nd. Transition to stage N3 \ne. Transition to stage R \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \nNote 1. An epoch of stage N2 meeting criteria in rule G.2 is termed definite stage N2 . \nIf there is a conflict between a stage N2 and stage R scoring rule, the stage R rule takes \nprecedence (see I.4). \n \nNote 2. Continue to score stage N1 for epochs with arousal-associated K complexes \nunless they contain sleep spindles or K complexes not associated with arousals. \n \nNote 3. For the purposes of scoring N2 sleep, arousals are defined according to \nthe arousal rule in chapter V. (V.A.1). \n \nNote 4. Although frequency changes associated with arousals and sleep spindles are \nmore typically noted in the central and occipital derivations respectively, these events \nshould be used to score sleep even if they are only noted in the frontal derivations. \n \nNote 5. For scoring epochs with a mixture of K complexes and/or sleep spindles and \nREMs, see rule I.7. \n \nNote 6. The EOG usually shows no eye movement activity during stage N2 sleep, but \nslow eye movements may persist in some individuals. \n \nNote 7. In stage N2, the chin EMG is of variable amplitude, but is usually lower than in \nstage W, and may be as low as in stage R sleep. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nH. Scoring Stage N3\nN1\n \n1. Score in accordance with the following definition:\nN2\n,\nN3\n   \nSlow wave activity: Waves of frequency 0.5-2 Hz and peak-to-peak amplitude \n>75 μV, measured over the frontal regions referenced to the contralateral ear \nor mastoid (F4-M1, F3-M2). \n2. Score stage N3 when ≥20% of an epoch consists of slow wave \nactivity, irrespective of age.\nN4\n,\nN5\n,\nN6\n   \nNote 1. Stage N3 represents slow wave sleep and replaces the Rechtschatten and Kales \nnomenclature of stage 3 and stage 4 sleep. \n \nNote 2. K complexes would be considered slow waves if they meet the definition of \nslow wave activity. \n \nNote 3. Pathological wave forms that meet the slow wave activity criteria, such as those \ngenerated by metabolic encephalopathies, epileptic, or epileptiform activity, are not \ncounted as slow wave activity of sleep. Similarly, waveforms produced by artifact or \nthose of non-cerebral origin should not be included in the scoring of slow waves. \n \nNote 4. Sleep spindles may persist in stage N3 sleep. \n \nNote 5. Eye movements are not typically seen during stage N3 sleep. \n \nNote 6. In stage N3, the chin EMG is of variable amplitude, often lower than in stage \nN2 sleep and sometimes as low as in stage R sleep. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nI. Scoring Stage R \n1. Score in accordance with the following definitions:   \nRapid eye movements (REMs): Eye movements recorded in the EOG \nderivations consisting of conjugate, irregular, sharply peaked eye movements \nwith an initial deflection usually lasting <500 msec. While rapid eye \nmovements are characteristic of stage R sleep, they may also be seen in \nwakefulness with eyes open when individuals visually scan the environment. \nLow chin EMG tone: Baseline EMG activity in the chin derivation no higher \nthan in any other sleep stage and usually at the lowest level of the entire \nrecording. \nSawtooth waves: An EEG pattern consisting of trains of sharply contoured or \ntriangular, often serrated, 2-6 Hz waves maximal in amplitude over the central \nhead regions and often, but not always, preceding a burst of rapid eye \nmovements. \nTransient muscle activity: Short irregular bursts of EMG activity usually with \nduration <0.25 seconds superimposed on low EMG tone. The activity may be \nseen in the chin or anterior tibial EMG derivations, as well as in EEG or EOG \ndeviations, the latter indicating activity of cranial nerve innervated muscles \n(facial and scalp muscles). The activity is often maximal when associated with \nrapid eye movements. \n\n2. Score stage R sleep in epochs with ALL of the following \nphenomena (definite stage R):\nN1\n,\nN2\n,\nN3\n,\nN4\n,\nN5\n,\nN6\n   \na. Low-amplitude, mixed-frequency (LAMF) EEG activity without K \ncomplexes or sleep spindles \nb. Low chin EMG tone for the majority of the epoch and concurrent \nwith REMs \nc. REMs at any position within the epoch \n3. Score segments of sleep preceding and contiguous with an epoch \nof definite stage R (as defined in I.2), in the absence of rapid eye \nmovements, as stage R if ALL of the following are present: (see \nFigures 10, 11 and 12)   \na. The EEG shows low-amplitude, mixed-frequency activity without \nK complexes or sleep spindles\nN4\n \nb. The chin EMG tone is low (at the stage R level) \nc. There is no intervening arousal (see Figure 11C) \nd. Slow eye movements following an arousal or stage W are absent\nN5\n \n \n\n \n \n\n4. If the majority of an epoch contains a segment of the recording \nmeeting criteria for stage R (I.2, I.3, I.5), the epoch is scored as \nstage R. Stage R rules take precedence over stage N2 rules. (see \nFigure 11, epoch 62 and Figure 12, epoch 72)   \n5. Continue to score segments of sleep that follow one or more \nepochs of definite stage R (as defined in I.2), in the absence of \nrapid eye movements, as stage R if ALL of the following are \npresent: (see Figures 13-17)   \na. The EEG shows LAMF EEG activity without K complexes or sleep \nspindles \nb. The chin EMG tone is low (at the stage R level) for the majority of \nthe epoch \nc. There is no intervening arousal \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n6. End scoring stage R sleep when ONE OR MORE of the following \noccur:   \na. There is a transition to stage W or N3 \nb. An increase in chin EMG tone above the level of stage R is seen \nfor the majority of the epoch and criteria for stage N1 are met (see \nFigure 13, epoch 62) \nc. An arousal occurs followed by low-amplitude, mixed-frequency \nEEG and slow eye movements (Score the epoch as stage N1; if \n\nthere are noslow eye movements and chin EMG tone remains low, \ncontinue to score as stage R) (see Figure 14) \nd. A major body movement followed by slow eye movements and \nlow-amplitude, mixed-frequency EEG without non-arousal \nassociated K complexes or sleep spindles (Score the epoch \nfollowing the major body movement as stage N1; if no slow eye \nmovements are present and the EMG tone remains low, continue \nto score as stage R; the epoch containing the body movement is \nscored using the criteria under heading J) (see Figure 15) \ne. One or more non-arousal associated K complexes or sleep spindles \nare present in the first half of the epoch in the absence of rapid eye \nmovements, even if chin EMG tone remains low (Score the epoch \nas stage N2) (see Figure 16) \n7. Score segments of the record with low chin EMG activity and a \nmixture of REMs and sleep spindles and/or K complexes as \nfollows:\nN1\n,\nN2\n,\nN3\n,\nN4\n,\nN5\n,\nN6\n   \na. Segments between two K complexes, two sleep spindles, or a K \ncomplex and sleep spindle without intervening REMs are \nconsidered to be stage N2. \nb. Segments of the record containing REMs without K complexes or \nsleep spindles and chin tone at the REM level are considered to be \nstage R. \nc. If the majority of an epoch contains a segment considered to be \nstage N2, it is scored as stage N2. If the majority of an epoch \ncontains a segment considered to be stage R, it is scored as stage R. \n(see Figure 17) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \nNote 1. Epochs defined by rule I.2 are called epochs of definite stage R.  \n \nNote 2. Low-amplitude, mixed-frequency activity in stage R resembles that seen in \nstage N1. In some individuals, a greater amount of alpha activity can be seen in stage R \nthan in stage N1. The alpha frequency in stage R often is 1-2 Hz slower than during \nwakefulness. \n \nNote 3. Sawtooth waves or transient muscle activity are strongly supportive of the \npresence of stage R sleep and may be helpful when the stage is in doubt, however, they \nare not required for scoring stage R. \n \nNote 4. For scoring epochs with low chin EMG tone and a mixture of REMs and K \ncomplexes or sleep spindles see I.7.  \n \nNote 5. Slow eye movements can occur during stage R but slow eye movements \nfollowing an arousal in combination with an EEG showing LAMF activity suggests a \ntransition to stage N1 even if the chin tone remains low. \n \nNote 6. Segments of the record with low chin EMG activity and a mixture of REM and \nsleep spindles and/or K complexes usually occur during the first REM period of the \nnight. \n \n \nJ. Scoring Epochs with Major Body Movements \n1. Score in accordance with the following definition:   \nMajor body movement: Movement and muscle artifact obscuring the EEG for \nmore than half an epoch to the extent that the sleep stage cannot be \ndetermined. \n2. If alpha rhythm is present for part of the epoch (even <15 seconds \nduration), score as stage W.   \n3. If no alpha rhythm is discernible, but an epoch scoreable as stage \nW either precedes or follows the epoch with a major body \nmovement, score as stage W.   \n4. Otherwise, score the epoch as the same stage as the epoch that \nfollows it.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nIV. Sleep Staging Rules Part 2: Rules for \nChildren \nA.

Sleep Staging Rules Part 1: Rules for Adults and III. \nTechnical and Digital Specifications for technical \nconsiderations other than those in the note below.\nN1\n   \nNote 1. Adult electrode derivations for EEG, EOG and chin EMG are acceptable for \nrecording sleep except that the distance between the chin EMG electrodes often needs to \nbe reduced from 2 cm to 1 cm and the distance from the eyes in EOG electrodes often \nneed to be reduced from 1 cm to 0.5 cm in children and infants with small head size. \n \n\nC. General Scoring of Sleep Stages \n1. The following terminology should be used when scoring sleep in \nchildren 2 months post-term or older:   \na. Stage W (Wakefulness) \nb. Stage N1 (NREM 1) \nc. Stage N2 (NREM 2) \nd. Stage N3 (NREM 3) \ne. Stage N (NREM) \nf. Stage R (REM) \nNot all sleep waveforms are well developed by 2 months post-term, \ntherefore, the following possible scenarios may apply:\nN1\n,\nN2\n,\nN3\n,\nN4\n,\nN5\n \n2. If all epochs of NREM sleep contain no recognizable sleep \nspindles, K complexes or high-amplitude 0.5-2 Hz slow wave \nactivity, score all epochs as stage N (NREM).   \n3. If some epochs of NREM sleep contain sleep spindles or K \ncomplexes, score those as stage N2 (NREM 2). If in the remaining \nNREM epochs, there is no slow wave activity comprising more \nthan 20% of the duration of epochs, score as stage N (NREM). \n  \n4. If some epochs of NREM sleep contain greater than 20% slow \nwave activity, score these as stage N3 (NREM 3). If in the \nremaining NREM epochs, there are no K complexes or spindles \nthen score as stage N (NREM).   \n5. If NREM is sufficiently developed that some epochs contain sleep \nspindles or K complexes and other epochs contain sufficient \namounts of slow wave activity, then score NREM sleep in this \ninfant as either stage N1, N2 or N3 as in an older child or adult. \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nNote 1. Sleep spindles may be seen by age 6 weeks - 3 months post-term and are \npresent in all normal infants by age 2-3 months post-term. At this age the spindles are \nasynchronous between the hemispheres but become more synchronous over the first \nyear of life. \n \nNote 2. K complexes are usually present by age 3-6 months post-term. \n \nNote 3. EEG activity of 0.5-2 Hz with a typical amplitude of 100-400 μV in the frontal \nregions may first appear by 2 months of age and is usually present by age 4-5 months \npost-term. The criteria for slow wave activity are the same as for adults \n(amplitude ≥75 μV of 0.5-2 Hz). \n \nNote 4. NREM sleep can be scored as stage N1, N2 or N3 in most infants by age 5-6 \nmonths post-term and occasionally in infants as young as 4 months post-term. \n \nNote 5. In infants younger than 6 months post-term, non-EEG parameters are helpful in \ndistinguishing NREM sleep from REM sleep. In REM sleep these parameters include \nthe presence of irregular respiration, loss of chin muscle tone, transient muscle activity \n(muscle twitches), and rapid eye movements. In NREM sleep, they consist of regular \nrespiration, absence of eye movements, and preserved chin muscle tone. \n \nD. Scoring Stage W \n1. Score in accordance with the following \ndefinitions:\nN1\n,\nN2\n,\nN3\n   \nEye blinks: Conjugate vertical eye movements at a frequency of 0.5-2 Hz present \nin wakefulness with eyes open or closed. \nReading eye movements: Trains of conjugate eye movements consisting of a \nslow phase followed by a rapid phase in the opposite direction as the child \nreads or visually scans the environment. \nRapid eye movements (REMs): Eye movements recorded in the EOG \nderivations consisting of conjugate, irregular, sharply peaked eye movements \nwith an initial deflection usually lasting <500 msec. While rapid eye \nmovements are characteristic of stage R sleep, they may also be seen in \nwakefulness with eyes open when individuals visually scan the environment. \nPosterior dominant rhythm (PDR): The dominant reactive EEG rhythm over \nthe occipital regions in relaxed wakefulness with eyes closed which is slower \nin infants and young children and attenuates with eye opening or attention. \nFrequency is 3.5-4.5 Hz when first seen in infants 3-4 months post-term, 5-6 \nHz by 5-6 months, and 7.5-9.5 Hz by 3 years of age and amplitude is usually \n>50 μV. In older children and adults, posterior dominant rhythm is often \nreferred to as alpha rhythm.\nN1\n,\nN2\n (see Table 1) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nTable 1. Initial Age of Waveform Appearance. \nWaveform Age of Initial Appearance \nSleep spindles 6 weeks - 3 months post-term \nK complexes 3-6 months post-term \nSlow wave activity 2-5 months post-term \nPosterior dominant rhythm \n \n \nFrequency of 3.5-4.5 Hz 3-4 months post-term \nFrequency of 5-6 Hz 5-6 months post-term \nFrequency of 7.5-9.5 Hz 3 years \nMean frequency of 9 Hz 9 years \nMean frequency of 10 Hz 15 years \nVertex sharp waves 4-6 months post-term \nHypnagogic hypersynchrony (HH) 3-6 months post-term \n2. Score epochs as stage W when more than 50% of the epoch \ncontains EITHER or BOTH:   \na. Age-appropriate posterior dominant rhythm over the occipital \nregion (individuals generating alpha rhythm with eye closure) \nb. Other findings consistent with stage W (all individuals) \ni. Eye blinks (0.5-2 Hz) \nii. Rapid eye movements associated with normal or high chin muscle tone \niii. Reading eye movements \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nNote 1. The PDR in infants and children typically contains intermixed slower EEG \nrhythms including: \n \na. Posterior slow waves of youth (PSW) which are intermittent runs of bilateral but \noften asymmetric 2.5-4.5 Hz slow waves superimposed, riding upon, or fused with the \nPDR, are usually <120% of PDR voltage, block with eye opening and disappear with \ndrowsiness and sleep. PSW are uncommon in children <2 years of age, have a maximal \nincidence between ages 8-14 years, and are uncommon after age 21 years. \n \nb. Random or semi-rhythmic occipital slowing: <100 μV, 2.5-4.5 Hz rhythmic or \narrhythmic activity lasting <3 seconds; a normal finding in EEGs of children ages 1-15 \nyears, especially prominent in ages 5-7 years; the amount of intermixed slowing \ndecreases and its frequency increases with increasing age. \n \nNote 2. Spontaneous eye closure in infants signals drowsiness. \n \nNote 3. The highest amplitude and sharpest component of reading eye movements in \nchildren is usually surface-negative in the occipital derivations, typically lasting 150-\n250 msec, and having amplitudes up to 65 μV. \n \n \nE. Scoring Stage N1 \n1. Score in accordance with the following definitions:   \nSlow eye movements (SEM): Conjugate, reasonably regular, sinusoidal eye \nmovements with an initial deflection that usually lasts >500 msec. Slow eye \nmovements may be seen during eyes closed wake and stage N1. \nLow-amplitude, mixed-frequency (LAMF) activity: Low amplitude, \npredominantly 4-7 Hz activity. \nVertex sharp waves (V waves): Sharply contoured waves with duration <0.5 \nseconds (as meausred at the base of the wave), maximal over the central region \nand distinguishable from the background activity. They are most often seen \nduring transition to stage N1 sleep but can occur in either stage N1 or N2 \nsleep. These waveforms typically first appear at 4-6 months post-term. \nSleep onset: The start of the first epoch scored as any stage other than stage W. \n(In most subjects this will usually be the first epoch of stage N1.). \nHypnagogic hypersynchrony (HH): Paroxysmal bursts or runs of diffuse, high-\namplitude, sinusoidal, 75-350 μV, 3-4.5 Hz waves which begin abruptly, are \nusually widely distributed but often are maximal over the central, frontal, or \nfrontocentral scalp regions. These waveforms can occur in stage N1 and N2. \n\n2. In individuals who generate a posterior dominant rhythm (PDR), \nscore stage N1 if the PDR is attenuated or replaced by low-\namplitude, mixed-frequency activity for more than 50% of the \nepoch.\nN1\n,\nN2\n,\nN3\n,\nN4\n   \n3. In individuals who do not generate a posterior dominant rhythm, \nscore stage N1 commencing with the earliest of ANY of the \nfollowing phenomena:\nN5\n   \na. Activity in the range of 4-7 Hz with slowing of background \nfrequencies by ≥1-2 Hz from those of stage W \nb. Slow eye movements \nc. Vertex sharp waves \nd. Hypnagogic hypersynchrony \ne. Diffuse or occipital-predominant, high-amplitude, rhythmic 3-5 Hz \nactivity \nNote 1. In most individuals, sleep onset will be the first epoch of stage N1, but in \ninfants younger than 2 months post-term, this is often stage R. \n \nNote 2. Drowsiness in infants up to 6-8 months of age is characterized by the gradual \nappearance of diffuse, high-amplitude (often 75-200 μV) 3-5 Hz activity which is \ntypically of higher amplitude, more diffuse, and 1-2 Hz slower than the waking EEG \nbackground activity. \n \nNote 3. Drowsiness in children 8 months to 3 years is characterized by either diffuse \nruns or bursts of rhythmic or semi-rhythmic bisynchronous 75-200 μV, 3-4 Hz activity \noften maximal over the occipital regions and/or higher amplitude (>200 μV) 4-6 Hz \ntheta activity maximal over the frontocentral or central regions. \n \nNote 4. Sleep onset from 3 years on is often characterized by a 1-2 Hz slowing of the \nPDR frequency and/or the PDR often becomes diffusely distributed then is gradually \nreplaced by relatively low-voltage, mixed-frequency EEG activity. \n \nNote 5. Hypnagogic hypersynchrony is a distinctive EEG pattern of drowsiness and \nstage N1 that often disappears with deeper stages of NREM sleep. HH is seen in \napproximately 30% of infants at 3 months post-term, 95% of all normal children ages 6-\n8 months, and is less prevalent after age 4-5 years; it is seen in only 10% of healthy \nchildren by age 11 and is rarely seen after age 12 years. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nF. Scoring Stage N2 \n1. Same as the adult rules found under the adult sleep staging \nrules heading G.\nN1\n,\nN2\n,\nN3\n   \nNote 1. Sleep spindles are usually are first seen in infants 4-6 weeks post-term as brief \nbursts of low-amplitude, less-sinusoidal 12-14 Hz activity maximal over the vertex \nregion, are usually well-developed and are present in all normal infants 8-9 weeks. \n \nNote 2. Eighty percent of children <13 years of age have two independent scalp \nlocations and frequency ranges for sleep spindles: 10.0-12.75 Hz over the frontal and \n12.5-14.75 Hz maximal over the central or centroparietal region. \n \nNote 3.

Slow wave activity in pediatric populations is often of high amplitude (100-\n400 μV), 0.5-2.0 Hz activity, maximal over the recommended derivations in the frontal \nscalp regions and first appears as early as 2 months, more often 3-4.5 months post-term. \n \n \nH.

The continuous, low-amplitude, mixed-frequency EEG activity of stage R in \ninfants and children resembles adults although the dominant frequencies increase with \nage: approximately 3 Hz activity at 7 weeks post-term, 4-5 Hz activity with bursts of \nsawtooth waves at 5 months, 4-6 Hz at 9 months, and prolonged runs or bursts of \nnotched 5-7 Hz theta activity at 1-5 years of age may populate the background activity. \nBy 5-10 years of age, the low-amplitude, mixed-frequency activity in stage R is similar \nto that of adults. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \nV.

Infant sleep staging rules should be used to score sleep and \nwakefulness in infants 0-2 months post-term (37-48 weeks \nconceptional age).\nN1\n,\nN2\n,\nN3\n,\nN4\n   \n \nNote 1. Conceptional age (CA) is gestational age (GA) at birth plus the number of \nweeks postpartum. GA is the time elapsed between the first day of the mother's last \nmenstrual period and the day of delivery expressed in completed weeks. If the \npregnancy was achieved using assisted reproductive technology, GA is calculated by \nadding 2 weeks to the CA. Chronological age (or postnatal or legal age) is the time \nelapsed since birth (can be expressed in days, months, or years). \n \nNote 2. At birth, an infant is classified as one of the following: premature (<37 weeks \ngestation); full-term (37-42 weeks); or post-term (born after 42 weeks). A neonate is a \nchild during the first 28 days after birth; an infant is a child age 1 to 12 months.\n1\n \n \nNote 3. Knowing an infant's CA is crucial for interpreting the normalcy, immaturity or \nabnormality of an EEG or PSG because the brain and the EEG continue to develop and \nmature at a similar rate independent of whether the infant is in utero or post-delivery.  \n \nNote 4. For premature infants (<37 weeks CA) refer to discussion in the Pediatric and \nInfant Scoring Task Force review paper. \n2\n \n \nReferences \n1. Engle WA.

Adult electrode derivations for EEG, EOG and chin EMG are \nacceptable when recording sleep except that the distance between \nthe chin EMG electrodes often needs to be reduced from 2 cm to 1 \ncm and the distance from the eyes in EOG electrodes often need \nto be reduced from 1 to 0.5 cm because of small infant head sizes. \n  \n3. Since sleep spindles are often asynchronous in children until 2 \nyears of age, and may be more prominent in the midline central \n(C3-Cz, C4-Cz) and central derivations (C3-M2, C4-M1), \nsimultaneous display of the recommended and backup electrodes \nand Cz (midline central) may be considered (e.g. montage to \nconsider: F4-M1, C4-M1, O2-M1, F3-M2, C3-M2, O1-M2, C4-Cz, \nC3-Cz).\nN1\n   \n4. Since behavioral patterns are extremely useful, synchronized \nvideo and audio recording is highly desirable.   \n \nNote 1. Since rudimentary sleep spindles first appear at 43 to 48 weeks CA at the \nmidline central (Cz, vertex) region and are often asynchronous, simultaneous display of \nleft, right and midline central EEG channels may be considered (e.g., C3-Cz, Cz-C4). In \ninfants this age, sleep spindles are often low voltage 12-14 Hz, not the wider range of \n11-16 Hz seen at later ages. \n \n \n \n \n\nC. General Scoring of Sleep Stages \n1. The following terminology should be used when scoring sleep in \ninfants 0-2 months post-term (37-48 weeks CA):\nN1\n,\nN2\n   \na. Stage W (Wakefulness) \nb. Stage N (NREM) \nc. Stage R (REM) \nd. Stage T (Transitional) \n2. Score epochs using the following rules:   \na. Score sleep stages in 30-second, sequential epochs commencing at \nthe start of the study \nb. Assign a stage to each epoch \nc. If two or more stages coexist, assign the stage comprising the \ngreatest portion of the epoch \nd. If two or more PSG characteristics are discordant for stage R or \nstage N sleep, score the epoch as stage T (Transitional) sleep \ne. Score sleep onset as the first epoch of sleep\nN3\n \n3. Sleep and wakefulness in infants 38 to 48 weeks CA are scored \nbased on behavioral observation; regularity or irregularity of \nrespiration; and EEG, EOG, and chin EMG patterns defined in \nTables 1-6.   \n4. Score sleep based on behavioral characteristics as defined in Table \n1.\nN4\n   \nTable 1. Behavioral characteristics of sleep stages. \nStage Behavioral Characteristics \nWake \nCalm or active with eyes open, scanning eye movements; Brief eye \nclosure can occur with crying\n \nN Eyes closed, few movements, sucking can occur \nR \nEyes closed, REM seen under closed eyelids, squirming, sucking, \ngrimacing, small movements of the face or limbs \n5. Score sleep based on the respiration characteristics as defined in \nTable 2.\nN5\n,\nN6\n   \nTable 2. Respiration characteristics of sleep stages. \nStage Respiration Characteristics \nWake Irregular, rapid, and shallow \nN Regular \n\nR \nIrregular, some central pauses (may or may not meet criteria for \napnea)\n \n6. Score sleep based on the EEG characteristics as defined in Table \n3. (see also Figure 1)   \nTable 3. EEG characteristics of sleep stages.\nN7\n,\nN8\n \nPatterns EEG Characteristics Stage(s) \nDiscontinuous \nTrace alternant \n(TA)\nN9,N10\n \nThis EEG pattern in full-term infants is generally only \nseen in stage N sleep. It is characterized by at least 3 \nalternating runs of bilaterally symmetrical synchronous \nhigh voltage (50-150\nμV) bursts of 1-3 Hz delta activity \nlasting 5-6 seconds (range 3-8 seconds) alternating with \nperiods of lower amplitude (25-50 \nμV) 4-7 Hz theta \nactivity (range 4-12 seconds). \nN \nContinuous \nLow voltage \nirregular (LVI) \nContinuous low voltage mixed-frequency activity with \ndelta and predominantly theta activity. \nR, \nWake \nHigh voltage slow \n(HVS)\nN11\n \nContinuous synchronous symmetrical predominantly high \nvoltage 1-3 Hz delta activity. \nN, \nrarely R \nMixed (M) \nBoth high voltage slow and low voltage polyrhythmic \ncomponents; these are intermingled with little periodicity. \nThe amplitude is lower than seen in the HVS pattern. \nWake, \nR, \nrarely N \nWaveforms of interest \nSleep spindles\nN12,N13\n \n12 to 14 Hz, asynchronous, most prominent in midline \ncentral (CZ) and central derivations. Occur only in stage \nN sleep.\n \nN \n\n \n7. Score sleep in accordance with the following definitions and based \non the EOG characteristics as defined in Table 4.   \nEye blinks: Conjugate vertical eye movements at a frequency of 0.5-2 Hz present \nin wakefulness with eyes open or closed. \nScanning eye movements: Trains of conjugate eye movements with eyes open \nconsisting of a slow phase followed by a rapid phase in the opposite direction \nas the infant visually scans the environment or follows objects.\nN14\n \nRapid eye movements (REMs): Eye movements recorded in the EOG \nderivations consisting of conjugate, irregular, sharply peaked eye movements \nwith an initial deflection usually lasting <500 msec. While rapid eye \nmovements are characteristic of stage R sleep, they may also be seen in \nwakefulness with eyes open when individuals visually scan the environment. \nTable 4. EOG characteristics of sleep stages. \nStage EOG Characteristics \nWake \nEye blinks, REMs, scanning eye movements; transient eye closures may \nbe seen in wakefulness especially when the infant is crying \nN Eyes closed, not moving \nR Eyes closed with REMs \n\n8. Score sleep in accordance with the following definitions and based \non the chin EMG patterns as defined in Table 5.    \nLow chin EMG tone: Baseline EMG activity in the chin derivation no higher \nthan in any other sleep stage and usually at the lowest level of the entire \nrecording. \nTransient muscle activity: Short irregular bursts of EMG activity usually with \nduration <0.25 seconds superimposed on low EMG tone. The activity may be \nseen in the chin or anterior tibial EMG derivations, as well as in EEG or EOG \ndeviations, the latter indicating activity of cranial nerve innervated muscles \n(facial and scalp muscles). The activity is often maximal when associated with \nrapid eye movements.. \n \nTable 5.

If NREM is sufficiently developed so that some epochs contain sleep spindles \nor K complexes and other epochs contain sufficient amounts of slow wave activity, then \nscore NREM sleep in this infant as either stage N1, N2 or N3 as in IV. Sleep Staging \nRules Part 2: Rules for Children, C.5. \n \nNote 2. Stage N is analogous to the previously used terminology of \"quiet sleep,\" stage \nR is analogous to the previously used terminology of \"active sleep,\" and stage T is \nanalogous to the previously used terminology of \"indeterminate sleep.\" \n \nNote 3. Up until 2 to 3 months post-term, the first epoch of sleep in infants is often \nstage R. \n \nNote 4. The transition to sleep in an infant is characterized by relative immobility, \nabsence of focused attention, and intermittent eye closure. If an infant's eyes are closed \nfor more than 3 minutes, the infant is considered asleep. Theta and delta activity, \nespecially over the frontal derivations, may increase in amplitude in transitions between \nW and sleep onset. \n \nNote 5. Regularity or irregularity of respiration during sleep is the most reliable PSG \ncharacteristic in differentiating stage N and stage R sleep, respectively. \n \nNote 6. Periodic breathing is common during stage R sleep and may rarely occur during \nstage N sleep in normal infants. \n \nNote 7. The EEG patterns of transitional sleep may contain any of the EEG \ncharacteristics outlined in Table 3. \n \nNote 8. Pathological EEG waveforms, such as those from spike and slow wave, \nprojected rhythms or those generated due to underlying pathology, should not be \nincluded in defining stage or state as noted in Table 3. \n \nNote 9. It is permissible to look at preceding and following epochs to identify the trace \nalternant (TA) pattern. \n \nNote 10. Trace alternant (TA) first appears at 37 weeks conceptional age (CA), is the \npredominant EEG pattern in stage N sleep at 40 weeks CA and unlikely to be seen after \n44 weeks CA. After 42 weeks CA, interburst intervals (IBIs) of TA last only 1-2 \nseconds and the IBI is of higher amplitude. TA after 44 weeks CA is replaced by high \nvoltage slow (HVS) activity. \n \nNote 11. High voltage slow (HVS) activity is the more mature EEG pattern of stage N \nsleep at term. It is characterized by continuous synchronous symmetrical 100-150 μV 1-\n3 Hz delta activity which often has an occipital or central predominance. \n\n \nNote 12. Since rudimentary sleep spindles first appear at 43 to 48 weeks CA at the \nmidline central (Cz, vertex) region and are often asynchronous, simultaneous display of \nleft, right and midline central EEG channels may be considered (e.g., C3-Cz, Cz-C4). In \ninfants this age, sleep spindles are often low voltage 12-14 Hz, not the wider range of \n11-16 Hz seen at later ages. \n \nNote 13. Since sleep spindles are often asynchronous in children until 2 years of age, \nsimultaneous display of the recommended and backup electrodes may be considered \n(e.g. montage to consider: F3-M2, F4-M1, C3-M2, C4-M1, O1-M2, O2-M1, C3-Cz, \nCz-C4). \n \nNote 14. Scanning eye movements can be seen as early as 2 weeks post-term. \n \nNote 15. Stage T (Transitional) is scored when 3 NREM and 2 REM or 2 NREM and 3 \nREM characteristics are present. \n \nNote 16. In epoch(s) contiguous and following an epoch of definite stage R (e.g. \ncontaining REMs). \n \nD. Scoring Stage W \n1. Score epochs as stage W if either a, b, or c is present for the \nmajority of the epoch:\nN1\n,\nN2\n (Figure 2)   \na. Eyes are wide open (for the majority of the epoch) \nb. Vocalization (whimpering, crying, etc.) or actively feeding \nc. All of the following are met: \ni. Eyes are open intermittently \nii. REMs or scanning eye movements \niii. Sustained chin EMG tone with bursts of muscle activity \niv. Irregular respiration \nv. EEG: LVI or M\nN3\n \n \n\nNote 1. Wake is most reliably scored by behavioral observations, because many of the \ndistinctive EEG features of wakefulness are not seen until after 2 months post-term.  \n \nNote 2. W (Wakefulness) is characterized by an EEG background of continuous, \nsymmetrical, irregular, low-to-medium amplitude mixed frequencies which may \ninclude: a) irregular theta and delta activity (to 100 μV) maximal in O1, O2; b) diffuse \nirregular alpha and beta activity (to 30 μV); c) rhythmic theta activity (to 50 μV), often \nmaximal in C3, Cz, C4; or d) artifacts from body movements, and eye movements. \n \nNote 3. This may have superimposed frequent movement artifacts. \n \nE. Scoring Stage N (NREM) \n1. Score stage N if four or more of the following are present, \nincluding regular respiration, for the majority of the \nepoch:\nN1\n,\nN2\n (Figures 3 and 4)   \na. Eyes closed with no eye movements \nb. Chin EMG tone present \nc. Regular respiration (post sigh respiratory pauses may occur) \nd. Trace alternant (TA), high voltage slow (HVS), or sleep spindles \npresent \ne. Reduced movement relative to wake \n \n\n \nNote 1.  Chin EMG in stage N is variable; it is generally lower than Wake and higher \nthan in stage R. That is, if chin EMG activity is present (higher than stage R) this is \nevidence for stage N (Table 5). However, stage N can still be scored with low EMG \ntone provided at least four other criteria for stage N including regular respiration are \nmet. \n \nNote 2. Regularity or irregularity of respiration during sleep is the most reliable PSG \ncharacteristic in differentiating stage N and stage R sleep, respectively. \n \n \n\nF. Scoring Stage R \n1. Score stage R sleep (definite R) in epochs with 4 or more of the \nfollowing criteria present, including irregular respiration AND \nrapid eye movement:\nN1\n (Figure 5)   \na. Low chin EMG (for the majority of the epoch)\nN2\n \nb. Eyes closed with at least one rapid eye movement (concurrent with \nlow chin tone) \nc. Irregular respiration \nd. Mouthing, sucking, twitches or brief head movements \ne. EEG exhibits a continuous pattern without sleep spindles\nN3\n \n2. Score segments of sleep contiguous with and following an epoch of \ndefinite R (as defined in F.1) in the absence of rapid eye \nmovements, as stage R if ALL of the following are present: \n  \na. The EEG shows low or medium amplitude mixed frequency \nactivity without trace alternant or sleep spindles \nb. The chin muscle tone is low for the majority of the epoch \nc. There is no intervening arousal (see chapter V. Arousal Rule, \nsame rule as for children and adults) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nNote 1. In infants, the first epoch of sleep is most commonly stage R. Given the \ndifficulty in determining sleep onset, an epoch of definite stage R is required to begin \nscoring this sleep stage.  \n \nNote 2. Epochs of stage R sleep containing periods without atonia (sustained activity or \ntransient muscle activity in the chin EMG) are not uncommon in infants. Bursts of \nmuscle activity during stage R often occur associated with movements. The intervening \nchin EMG activity between movements is usually low. \n \nNote 3. Continuous EEG pattern includes low voltage irregular (LVI), high voltage \nslow (HVS), and mixed (M) (Table 3 ). \n \n \nG. Scoring Stage T \n1. Score an epoch as stage N, stage R or stage W if only one PSG \ncharacteristic is discordant for the sleep state.\nN1\n,\nN2\n   \n2. Score an epoch as stage T (transitional) if it contains either 3 \nNREM and 2 REM characteristics or 2 NREM and 3 REM \ncharacteristics. (Table 6, Figure 6)   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nNote 1. Transitional (T) or indeterminate sleep is common in infants because of \ndiscordant features (contains physiological markers of more than one sleep state). \n \nNote 2. The terminology Transitional (T) sleep is favored over indeterminate sleep as \nthe sleep stage most often occurs in transitions from stage W to stage R sleep, before \nawakening and at sleep onset. \n \nH.

Score arousal during sleep stages N1, N2, N3, or R if there is an \nabrupt shift of EEG frequency including alpha, theta and/or \nfrequencies greater than 16 Hz (but not spindles) that lasts at \nleast 3 seconds, with at least 10 seconds of stable sleep preceding \nthe change. Scoring of arousal during REM requires a concurrent \nincrease in submental EMG lasting at least 1 \nsecond.\nN1\n,\nN2\n,\nN3\n,\nN4\n,\nN5\n   \n \n \nNote 1. Arousal scoring should incorporate information from the frontal, central, and \noccipital derivations. \n \nNote 2. Arousal scoring can be improved by the use of additional information in the \nrecording such as respiratory events and/or additional EEG channels. Scoring of \narousals, however, cannot be based on this additional information alone and such \ninformation does not modify any of the arousal scoring rules. \n \nNote 3. Arousals meeting all scoring criteria but occurring during an awake epoch in the \nrecorded time between \"lights out\" and \"lights on\" should be scored and used for \ncomputation of the arousal index. \n \nNote 4. The 10 seconds of stable sleep required prior to scoring an arousal may begin in \nthe preceding epoch, including a preceding epoch that is scored as stage W. \n \nNote 5. An arousal may still be scored if it immediately precedes a transition to stage \nW.

For monitoring leg movements (LMs), surface electrodes should \nbe placed longitudinally and symmetrically in the middle of the \nanterior tibialis muscle so that they are 2-3 cm apart or 1/3 of the \nlength of the anterior tibialis muscle, whichever is shorter. Both \nlegs should be monitored for the presence of the leg movements. \nSeparate channels for each leg are strongly preferred. Combining \nelectrodes from the 2 legs to give 1 recorded channel may suffice \nfor some clinical settings, although it should be recognized that \nthis strategy may reduce the number of detected LMs. (see Figure \n1)   \n \n2. For monitoring leg movements, use of 60 Hz (notch) filters should \nbe avoided. Impedances need to be less than 10,000 Ω. Less than \n5,000 Ω is preferred but may be difficult to obtain.   \n3. Movements of the upper limbs may be sampled using a similar \nmethod as for legs if clinically indicated. (see Figures 2 and 3)   \n \n\n \n4. For detecting bruxism, in addition to the recommended placement \nof chin EMG electrodes as noted in the adult sleep staging rules \nchapter (IV.C), additional masseter electrodes may be placed if \nclinically indicated.\nN2\n(see Figure 4)   \n \n5. For detecting transient muscle activity in REM sleep, use one of \nthe following EMG recordings:\nN3\n   \na. Flexor digitorum superficialis (see Figure 2) \nb. Extensor digitorum communis (see Figure 3) \n6. For diagnosis of RBD, time-synchronized, audio-equipped video \nPSG is essential to document complex motor behaviors and \nvocalizations during REM sleep. A diagnosis of RBD is based on \ndemonstration of such episodes or a characteristic clinical history \nof dream enactment in addition to polysomnographic evidence of \nREM sleep without atonia.   \n7. For monitoring rhythmic movement disorder (RMD), bipolar \nsurface electrodes should be placed to record electrical activity of \nthe large muscle groups involved.\nN3\n (see Figure 5)   \n\n \n8. For diagnosis of RMD, time-synchronized video PSG is necessary \nto accurately characterize the disorder, in addition to \npolysomnographic criteria.   \nNote 1. For accurate electrode placement, the patient should be asked to activate the \nmuscle so that the muscle can be more readily felt. The following are the actions to \nactivate various muscles: \n       ● Anterior tibialis: patient should raise foot toward their head or flex their foot up \n       ● Flexor digitorm superficialis: patient should bend only at the base of their fingers \n(avoid bending at the distal two joints) \n       ● Extensor digitorum communis: patient should extend their fingers back without \nmoving their wrist \n       ● Masseter: patient should bite down \n \nNote 2. If two electrodes are used (see Figure 4), they should be 2-3 cm apart. A single \nmasseter electrode may be used using a chin EMG electrode as the reference. \n \nNote 3.

The following define a significant leg movement (LM) \nevent:\nN1\n   \na. The minimum duration of a LM event is 0.5 seconds. \nb. The maximum duration of a LM event is 10 seconds. \nc. The minimum amplitude of a LM event is an 8 μV increase in \nEMG voltage above resting EMG (duration of at least 0.5 seconds). \nd. The timing of the onset of a LM event is defined as the point at \nwhich there is an 8 μV increase in EMG voltage above resting \nEMG. \ne. The timing of the ending of a LM event is defined as the start of a \nperiod lasting at least 0.5 seconds during which the EMG does not \nexceed 2μV above resting EMG. \n2. The following define a PLM series:\nN2\n   \na. The minimum number of consecutive LM events needed to define a \nPLM series is 4 LMs. \nb. The period length between LMs (defined as the time between \nonsets of consecutive LMs) to include them as part of a PLM series \nis 5 to 90 seconds. \nc. Leg movements on 2 different legs separated by less than 5 seconds \nbetween movement onsets are counted as a single leg movement. \nThe period length to the next LM following this group of LMs is \nmeasured from the onset of the first LM to the onset of the next. \n(see Figure 6) \n \n3. An arousal and a limb movement that occur in a PLM series \nshould be considered associated with each other if they occur \nsimultaneously, overlap, or when there is <0.5 seconds between \nthe end of one event and the onset of the other event regardless of \nwhich is first. (see Figure 7) \n\n \n4. An LM should not be scored if it occurs during a period from 0.5 \nseconds preceding an apnea, hypopnea, RERA or sleep-\ndisordered breathing event to 0.5 seconds following the event. \n5. When a period of wake <90 seconds separates a series of LMs, this \ndoes not prevent LMs preceding the period of wake from being \nincluded with the subsequent LMs as part of a PLM series. (see \nFigure 8) \n \n\nNote 1. Rule 1.c. defines a significant leg movement event by an absolute increase of \n8 μ V above resting baseline for the anterior tibialis EMG. This requires a stable resting \nEMG for the relaxed anterior tibialis whose absolute signal should be no greater than \n+10 μV between negative and positive deflection (±5 μV) or +5 μV for rectified signals. \n \nNote 2. When periodic limb movements occur with an interval of less than 10 seconds \nand each is associated with a ≥ 3 second change in the EEG/chin EMG meeting criteria \nfor an arousal, only the first EEG/chin EMG change should be scored as an arousal \n(assuming it is preceded by at least 10 seconds of sleep). Both limb movements may be \nscored, assuming the onsets are separated by 5 seconds or more, but only one PLM \nassociated with an arousal (and only one arousal) would be scored. \n \n \nC. Scoring Alternating Leg Muscle Activation (ALMA) \n1. The following define ALMA:\nN1\n,\nN2\n,\nN3\n   \na. The minimum number of discrete and alternating EMG bursts of \nleg muscle activity events needed to score an ALMA series is 4 \nALMAs. \nb. The minimum frequency of the alternating EMG bursts in ALMA \nis 0.5 Hz. \nc. The maximum frequency of the alternating EMG bursts in ALMA \nis 3.0 Hz. \n \n \nNote 1. ALMAs alternate between legs. \n \nNote 2. The usual range for duration of ALMA is 100-500 msec. \n \nNote 3. ALMA may simply be a benign movement phenomenon associated with \ncharacteristic EMG patterns as there have been no reported clinical consequences. \n \n \n \nD. Scoring Hypnagogic Foot Tremor (HFT) \n1. The following define HFT:\nN1\n,\nN2\n   \na. The minimum number of EMG bursts needed to make a train of \nbursts in a HFT series is 4 HFT bursts. \nb. The minimum frequency of the EMG bursts in a HFT is 0.3 Hz. \nc. The maximum frequency of the EMG bursts in a HFT is 4.0 Hz. \nNote 1. The usual range for duration of hypnagogic foot tremor is 250-1000 msec. \n \nNote 2. HFT may simply be a benign movement phenomenon associated with \ncharacteristic EMG patterns as there have been no reported clinical consequences. \n \n \n\nE. Scoring Excessive Fragmentary Myoclonus (EFM) \n1. The following define EFM:\nN1\n,\nN2\n,\nN3\n   \na. The usual maximum EMG burst duration seen in fragmentary \nmyoclonus is 150 msec. \nb. At least 20 minutes of NREM sleep with EFM must be recorded. \nc. At least 5 EMG potentials per minute must be recorded. \n \nNote 1. EFM may be a benign movement phenomenon associated with a characteristic \nEMG pattern as there have been no reported clinical consequences. \n \nNote 2. In many cases no visible movements are present. Gross, jerk-like movements \nacross the joint spaces are not observed. When minor movement across a joint space is \npresent, the movement resembles the small twitch-like movements of the fingers, toes, \nand the corner of the mouth intermittently seen in REM sleep in normal individuals. \n \nNote 3. In some cases when visible movement is present, the EMG burst duration may \nbe >150 msec. \n \n \nF. Scoring Bruxism \n1. The following define bruxism:\nN1\n,\nN2\n   \na. Bruxism may consist of brief (phasic) or sustained (tonic) \nelevations of chin EMG activity that are at least twice the \namplitude of background EMG. \nb. Brief elevations of chin or masseter EMG activity are scored as \nbruxism if they are 0.25-2 seconds in duration and if at least 3 such \nelevations occur in a regular sequence. \nc. Sustained elevations of chin or masseter EMG activity are scored \nas bruxism if the duration is more than 2 seconds. \nd. A period of at least 3 seconds of stable background chin EMG must \noccur before a new episode of bruxism can be scored. \ne. Bruxism can be scored reliably by audio in combination with \npolysomnography by a minimum of 2 audible tooth grinding \nepisodes/night of polysomnography in the absence of epilepsy. \n \nNote 1. In sleep, jaw contraction frequently occurs. This contraction can take 2 forms: \na) sustained (tonic) jaw clenching contractions or b) a series of repetitive brief (phasic) \nmuscle contractions termed rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (RMMA). \n \nNote 2. Characteristic changes in masseter EMG are often more prominent than changes \nin the chin EMG. \n \n \n \n \n\nG. Scoring PSG Features of REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD) \n1. Score in accordance with the following definitions:   \nSustained muscle activity (tonic activity) in REM sleep: An epoch of REM \nsleep with at least 50% of the duration of the epoch having a chin EMG \namplitude greater than the minimum amplitude demonstrated in NREM sleep. \nExcessive transient muscle activity (phasic activity) in REM sleep: In a 30-\nsecond epoch of REM sleep divided into 10 sequential 3-second mini-epochs, \nat least 5 (50%) of the mini-epochs contain bursts of transient muscle activity. \nIn RBD, excessive transient muscle activity bursts are 0.1-5.0 seconds in \nduration and at least 4 times as high in amplitude as the background EMG \nactivity. \n2. The polysomnographic characteristics of RBD are characterized \nby EITHER or BOTH of the following features:\nN1\n,\nN2\n,\nN3\n   \na. Sustained muscle activity in REM sleep in the chin EMG \nb. Excessive transient muscle activity during REM in the chin or limb \nEMG \nNote 1. Transient muscle activity and occasional accompanying visible twitching of \nsmall muscle groups are a normal phenomenon seen in REM sleep (see IV.I.1). When \nlarger muscle groups are involved, this activity is not associated with large, overt \nmuscular activity acting across large joints. When smaller muscle groups are involved, \nthe movement often involves the distal muscles of the hands and face or the corners of \nthe mouth. Transient muscle activity may be excessive in RBD. \n \nNote 2. The sustained muscle activity or the excessive transient muscle activity \nobserved in REM sleep may be interrupted by superimposed (usually dream-enacting) \nbehaviors of RBD. \n \nNote 3. In normal individuals there is an atonia seen in REM sleep in the chin and \nanterior tibialis EMG. In this state the baseline amplitude of the EMG signal decreases \nmarkedly. This atonia of REM sleep is lost to a considerable extent in RBD, with \nvariable frequency, and as a result, the EMG baseline amplitude is often higher. In this \nsituation, the EMG can be said to be in a tonic rather than atonic state. \n \nH. Scoring the PSG Features of Rhythmic Movement Disorder \n1. The following define the polysomnographic characteristics of \nrhythmic movement disorder:   \na. The minimum frequency for scoring rhythmic movements is 0.5 \nHz. \nb. The maximum frequency for scoring rhythmic movements is 2.0 \nHz. \nc. The minimum number of individual movements required to make a \ncluster of rhythmic movements is 4 movements. \nd. The minimum amplitude of an individual rhythmic burst is 2 times \nthe background EMG activity. \n \n \n\nVIII. Respiratory Rules \n \nPart 1: Rules for Adults \nA. Technical Specifications \nB.

For identification of an apnea during a diagnostic study, use an \noronasal thermal airflow sensor to monitor airflow.\nN1\n   \n2. For identification of an apnea during a diagnostic study when the \noronasal thermal airflow sensor is not functioning or the signal is \nnot reliable, use one of the following (alternative apnea sensors):\nN2\n \na. nasal pressure transducer (with or without square root \ntransformation)   \nb. Respiratory inductance plethysmography sum (RIPsum) (calibrated \nor uncalibrated)   \nc. Respiratory inductance plethysmography flow (RIPflow) \n(calibrated or uncalibrated)   \nd. PVDFsum   \n3. For identification of a hypopnea during a diagnostic study, use a \nnasal pressure transducer (with or without square root \ntransformation of the signal) to monitor airflow.\nN3\n   \n4. For identification of a hypopnea during a diagnostic study when \nthe nasal pressure transducer is not functioning or the signal is not \nreliable, use one of the following (alternative hypopnea sensors):\nN2\n \na. oronasal thermal airflow   \nb. RIPsum (calibrated or uncalibrated)   \nc. RIPflow (calibrated or uncalibrated)   \nd. dual thoracoabdominal RIP belts (calibrated or uncalibrated) \n  \ne. PVDFsum    \n5. During positive airway pressure (PAP) titration, use the PAP \ndevice flow signal to identify apneas or hypopneas.   \n6. For monitoring respiratory effort, use one of the following: \na. esophageal manometry   \nb. dual thoracoabdominal RIP belts (calibrated or uncalibrated) \n  \nc. dual thoracoabdominal PVDF belts   \n7. For monitoring oxygen saturation, use pulse oximetry with a \nmaximum acceptable signal averaging time of≤3 seconds at a \nheart rate of 80 beats per minute.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \nB. Measuring Event Duration \n1. For scoring either an apnea or a hypopnea, the event duration is \nmeasured from the nadir preceding the first breath that is clearly \nreduced to the beginning of the first breath that approximates the \nbaseline breathing amplitude. (see red bracket, \nFigures 1 and 2)   \n2. For apnea duration, the oronasal thermal sensor signal \n(diagnostic study) or PAP device flow signal (PAP titration study) \nshould be used to determine the event duration. For hypopnea \nevent duration, the nasal pressure signal (diagnostic study) or \nPAP device flow signal (PAP titration study) should be utilized. \nWhen the diagnostic study sensors fail or are \ninaccurate, alternative sensors may be used. (see Technical \nSpecifications for adults A.2 and A.4)   \n3. When baseline breathing amplitude cannot be easily determined \n(and when underlying breathing variability is large), events can \nalso be terminated when either there is a clear and sustained \nincrease in breathing amplitude, or in the case where a \ndesaturation has occurred, there is event-associated resaturation \nof at least 2%.   \n \n\n \n \n \nC. Scoring of Apneas \n \n1. Score a respiratory event as an apnea when BOTH of the \nfollowing criteria are met:\nN1\n,\nN2\n,\nN3\n,\nN4\n (see Figure 1)    \na. There is a drop in the peak signal excursion by ≥90% of pre-event \nbaseline using an oronasal thermal sensor (diagnostic study), PAP \ndevice flow (titration study) or an alternative apnea sensor \n(diagnostic study). \nb. The duration of the ≥90% drop in sensor signal is ≥10 seconds. \n2. Score an apnea as obstructive if it meets apnea criteria and is \nassociated with continued or increased inspiratory effort \nthroughout the entire period of absent airflow.   \n3. Score an apnea as central if it meets apnea criteria and is \nassociated with absent inspiratory effort throughout the entire \nperiod of absent airflow.   \n4. Score an apnea as mixed if it meets apnea criteria and is \nassociated with absent inspiratory effort in the initial portion of \nthe event, followed by resumption of inspiratory effort in the \nsecond portion of the event.\nN5\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nNote 1. Identification of an apnea does not require a minimum desaturation criterion. \n \nNote 2. If a portion of a respiratory event that would otherwise meet criteria for a \nhypopnea meets criteria for apnea, the entire event should be scored as an apnea. \n \nNote 3. If the apnea or hypopnea event begins or ends during an epoch that is scored as \nsleep, then the corresponding respiratory event can be scored and included in the \ncomputation of the apnea hypopnea index (AHI). This situation usually occurs when an \nindividual has a high AHI with events occurring so frequently that sleep is severely \ndisrupted and epochs may end up being scored as wake even though <15 seconds of \nsleep is present during the epoch containing that portion of the respiratory event. \nHowever, if the apnea or hypopnea occurs entirely during an epoch scored as wake, it \nshould not be scored or counted towards the apnea hypopnea index because of the \ndifficulty of defining a denominator in this situation. If these occurrences are a \nprominent feature of the polysomnogram and/or interfere with sleep onset, their \npresence should be mentioned in the narrative summary of the study. \n \nNote 4. For alternative apnea sensors see Technical Specifications for adults A.2. \n \nNote 5. There is not sufficient evidence to support a specific duration of the central and \nobstructive components of a mixed apnea; thus, specific durations of these components \nare not recommended. \n \n \n \nD. Scoring of Hypopneas \nScoring hypopneas as central or obstructive events is optional as noted in Parameters \nto be Reported II.F. \n\n1A. Score a respiratory event as a hypopnea if ALL of the following \ncriteria are met:\nN1\n,\nN2\n,\nN3\n (see Figure 2)   \na. The peak signal excursions drop by ≥30% of pre-event baseline \nusing nasal pressure (diagnostic study), PAP device flow (titration \nstudy), or an alternative hypopnea sensor (diagnostic study). \nb. The duration of the ≥30% drop in signal excursion is ≥10 seconds. \nc. There is a ≥3% oxygen desaturation from pre-event baseline or the \nevent is associated with an arousal. \n1B. Score a respiratory event as a hypopnea if ALL of the following \ncriteria are met:\nN1\n,\nN2\n,\nN3\n   \na. The peak signal excursions drop by ≥30% of pre-event baseline \nusing nasal pressure (diagnostic study), PAP device flow (titration \nstudy), or an alternative hypopnea sensor (diagnostic study). \nb. The duration of the ≥30% drop in signal excursion is ≥10 seconds. \nc. There is a ≥4% oxygen desaturation from pre-event baseline. \n2. If electing to score obstructive hypopneas, score a hypopnea \nas obstructive if ANY of the following criteria are met: \n  \na. There is snoring during the event. \nb. There is increased inspiratory flattening of the nasal pressure or \nPAP device flow signal compared to baseline breathing. \nc. There is an associated thoracoabdominal paradox that occurs \nduring the event but not during pre-event breathing. \n3. If electing to score central hypopneas, score a hypopnea \nas central if NONE of the following criteria are met:   \na. There is snoring during the event. \nb. There is increased inspiratory flattening of the nasal pressure or \nPAP device flow signal compared to baseline breathing. \nc. There is an associated thoracoabdominal paradox that occurs \nduring the event but not during pre-event breathing. \n \nNote 1. The criteria used to score a respiratory event as a hypopnea (either rule 1A or \n1B) should be specified in the PSG report. It is the responsibility of the individual \npractitioner to confirm and follow the criteria that should be used for reporting to the \npatient’s payer in order to be reimbursed and qualify the patient for therapy. \n \nNote 2. For alternative hypopnea sensors see Technical Specifications for adults \nA.4. \n \nNote 3. Supplemental oxygen may blunt desaturation. There are currently no scoring \nguidelines for when a patient is on supplemental oxygen and no desaturation is noted. If \nthe diagnostic study is performed while the individual is on supplemental oxygen, its \npresence should be mentioned in the narrative summary of the study. \n\nE. Scoring Respiratory Effort-Related Arousal \nScoring respiratory effort-related arousals is optional as noted in Parameters to be \nReported II.F. \n1. If electing to score respiratory effort-related arousals, score a \nrespiratory event as a respiratory effort-related arousal (RERA) \nif there is a sequence of breaths lasting ≥10 seconds characterized \nby increasing respiratory effort or by flattening of the inspiratory \nportion of the nasal pressure (diagnostic study) or PAP device \nflow (titration study) waveform leading to arousal from sleep \nwhen the sequence of breaths does not meet criteria for an apnea \nor hypopnea.

If electing to score hypoventilation, score hypoventilation during \nsleep if EITHER of the below occur:\nN1\n,\nN2\n   \na. There is an increase in the arterial PCO\n2\n (or surrogate) to a value \n>55 mmHg for ≥10 minutes. \nb. There is ≥10 mmHg increase in arterial PCO\n2\n (or surrogate) during \nsleep (in comparison to an awake supine value) to a value \nexceeding 50 mmHg for ≥10 minutes. \nNote 1. See Technical Specifications for adults A.9 and A.10 for information on \nsurrogate signals for monitoring hypoventilation. \n \nNote 2. Use the following conversion factor in order to change the units of the pressures \nlisted from mmHg to kPa: 1 mmHg = 0.133 kPA. \n \n \n \n \n \n\nG. Scoring Cheyne-Stokes Breathing \n1. Score a respiratory event as Cheyne-Stokes breathing if BOTH of \nthe following are met: (see Figure 4)\nN1\n,\nN2\n   \na. There are episodes of ≥3 consecutive central apneas and/or central \nhypopneas separated by a crescendo and decrescendo change in \nbreathing amplitude with a cycle length of ≥40 seconds. \nb. There are ≥5 central apneas and/or central hypopneas per hour of \nsleep associated with the crescendo/decrescendo breathing pattern \nrecorded over ≥2 hours of monitoring. \n \nNote 1. Cycle length is the time from the beginning of a central apnea to the end of the \nnext crescendo-decrescendo respiratory phase (start of the next apnea). \n \nNote 2. Central apneas that occur within a run of Cheyne-Stokes breathing should be \nscored as individual apneas as well. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nVIII.

For monitoring oxygen saturation, use pulse oximetry with a \nmaximum acceptable signal averaging time of≤3 seconds at a \nheart rate of 80 beats per minute.   \n8.

For detection of hypoventilation during a diagnostic study, use \narterial PCO\n2\n, transcutaneous PCO\n2\n or end-tidal \nPCO\n2\n.\nN5\n,\nN6\n   \n10. For detection of hypoventilation during PAP titration, use \narterial PCO\n2\n, or use transcutaneous PCO\n2\n.\nN5\n,\nN6\n   \n\nNote 1. Thermal sensors include thermistors, thermocouples, or polyvinylidene fluoride \n(PVDF) airflow sensors. \n \nNote 2. The RIPsum is the sum of the signals from thoracic and abdominal RIP sensors \n(belts) and excursions in the signal are an estimate of tidal volume. The RIPflow is the \ntime derivative of the RIPsum and excursions in the signal are an estimate of airflow. \nRecording of RIPsum or RIPflow is optional. \n \nNote 3. Using the nasal pressure signal without square root transformation for scoring \nhypopneas will result in a slightly higher hypopnea index than scoring using a square \nroot transformation of the signal.

For identification of respiratory events (RE) based on respiratory \nairflow during a home sleep apnea test (HSAT) diagnostic study, \nuse at least one of the following sensors:\nN1\n \na. oronasal thermal airflow sensor\nN2\n   \nb. nasal pressure transducer (with or without square root \ntransformation)\nN3\n,\nN4\n   \nc. alternative sensors include:\nN5\n \ni. respiratory inductance plethysmography sum (RIPsum) or flow (RIPflow) \n  \nii. PVDFsum   \n2. For monitoring respiratory effort,\nN6\n use one of the following \ntechnologies: \na. single or dual thoracoabdominal RIP belts\nN5\n    \nb. single or dual thoracoabdominal PVDF belts\nN5\n   \nc. single or dual thoracoabdominal piezo belts\nN5\n   \nd. single or dual pneumatic belts\nN5\n   \n3. For monitoring oxygen saturation, use pulse \noximetry.\nN7\n   \n4. For monitoring snoring, use an acoustic sensor (e.g. microphone), \npiezoelectric sensor or nasal pressure transducer.   \n \nNote 1. At least one airflow sensor is required. Ideally both an oronasal thermal sensor \nand a nasal pressure transducer should be used to record airflow. An alternative sensor \n(as listed above) may be a substituted for an oronasal thermal sensor.  \n \nNote 2. Thermal sensors include thermistors, thermocouples, or polyvinylidene fluoride \n(PVDF) airflow sensors. If used without simultaneous nasal pressure monitoring, some \nthermal sensors may be less sensitive for detection of hypopneas.  \n \nNote 3. Using the nasal pressure signal without square root transformation for scoring \nsleep-related respiratory events (SRE) will result in a slightly higher hypopnea index \nthan scoring using a square root transformation of the signal. This difference is not \nclinically significant in most patients. \n \nNote 4. If the nasal pressure signal is used without simultaneous recording of oronasal \nthermal sensor signal, some hypopneas may be classified as apneas. \n \nNote 5. The RIPsum is the sum of the signals from thoracic and abdominal RIP sensors \n(belts) and excursions in the signal are an estimate of tidal volume. The RIPflow is the \ntime derivative of the RIPsum and excursions in the signal are an estimate of airflow. \nThe PVDFsum is the sum of signals from thoracic and abdominal PVDF sensors \n(belts).  \n\n \nNote 6. Only CPT code 95806 requires respiratory effort monitoring. If respiratory \neffort monitoring is performed one of these technologies should be used. The use of two \nbelts is preferred; however, one respiratory monitoring belt is acceptable.  \n \nNote 7. The recording device should meet the same requirements for oximetry as the in-\nlab PSG. \n \nF. HSAT Respiratory Events Rules: Scoring Apnea Utilizing Respiratory \nFlow and/or Effort Sensors \n1. Score a respiratory event as an apnea when BOTH of the \nfollowing criteria are met:\nN1\n,\nN2\n,\nN3\n,\nN4\n   \na. There is a drop in the peak signal excursion by ≥90% of pre-event \nbaseline using a recommended or alternative airflow sensor. \nb. The duration of the ≥90% drop in sensor signal is ≥10 seconds. \n2. Score an apnea as obstructive if it meets apnea criteria and is \nassociated with continued or increased inspiratory effort \nthroughout the entire period of absent airflow.   \n3. Score an apnea as central if it meets apnea criteria and is \nassociated with absent inspiratory effort throughout the entire \nperiod of absent airflow.   \n4. Score an apnea as mixed if it meets apnea criteria and is \nassociated with absent inspiratory effort in the initial portion of \nthe event, followed by resumption of inspiratory effort in the \nsecond portion of the event.   \n \nNote 1. Identification of an apnea does not require a minimum desaturation criterion. \n \nNote 2. If a portion of a respiratory event that would otherwise meet criteria for a \nhypopnea meets criteria for apnea, the entire event should be scored as an apnea. \n \nNote 3. There is not sufficient evidence to support a specific duration of the central and \nobstructive components of a mixed apnea; thus, specific durations of these components \nare not recommended. \n \nNote 4. Some devices may not differentiate between different types of apneas. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nG. HSAT Respiratory Events Rules: Scoring Hypopnea Utilizing \nRespiratory Flow and/or Effort Sensors\nN1\n \n1A. If sleep is NOT recorded, score a respiratory event as a \nhypopnea if ALL of the following criteria are met:\nN1\n   \na. The peak signal excursions drop by ≥30% of pre-event baseline \nusing a recommended or alternative airflow sensor. \nb. The duration of the ≥30% drop in signal excursion is ≥10 seconds. \nc. There is a ≥3% oxygen desaturation from pre-event baseline. \n1B. If sleep is NOT recorded, score a respiratory event as a \nhypopnea if ALL of the following criteria are met:\nN1\n   \na. The peak signal excursions drop by ≥30% of pre-event baseline \nusing a recommended or alternative airflow sensor. \nb. The duration of the ≥30% drop in signal excursion is ≥10 seconds. \nc. There is a ≥4% oxygen desaturation from pre-event baseline. \n2A. If sleep IS recorded, score a respiratory event as a hypopnea if \nALL of the following criteria are met:\nN1\n,\nN2\n   \na. The peak signal excursions drop by ≥30% of pre-event baseline \nusing a recommended or alternative airflow sensor. \nb. The duration of the ≥30% drop in signal excursion is ≥10 seconds. \nc. There is a ≥3% oxygen desaturation from pre-event baseline or the \nevent is associated with an arousal.\nN2\n \n2B. If sleep IS recorded, score a respiratory event as a hypopnea if \nALL of the following criteria are met:\nN1\n,\nN2\n   \na. The peak signal excursions drop by ≥30% of pre-event baseline \nusing a recommended or alternative airflow sensor. \nb. The duration of the ≥30% drop in signal excursion is ≥10 seconds. \nc. There is a ≥4% oxygen desaturation from pre-event baseline. \n \nNote 1. The criteria used to score a respiratory event as a hypopnea should be specified \nin the report.  \n \nNote 2. Scoring a hypopnea based on arousals is only possible if sleep is recorded. \n \nH.

Development Process \nDevelopment of Version 2.0 and Future Updates \nThe principal participants in the development of Version 2.0 included: a) the scoring \nmanual committee of 5 clinicians with a range of expertise, 1 technologist and 1 board \nliaison appointed by the AASM Board of Directors, b) the 13 members of the Sleep \nApnea Definitions (SAD) Task Force appointed by the AASM Board of Directors and \nc) the science and research, graphics, communications, and information technology staff \nof the AASM. The SAD Task Force consisted of 9 of the original 13 individuals who \nauthored the evidence review\n1\n used to develop the 2007 respiratory scoring rules and 4 \nadditional respiratory scoring experts. After a review of the literature, the task force \ndeveloped recommendations on the sensors and rules to be used for scoring respiratory \nevents, which were subsequently approved by the AASM Board of Directors. More \ninformation on the methods used and the evidence examined by the SAD task force may \nbe found in the review paper\n2\n published in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine. \nFor the most part, the content of the chapters on parameters to be reported, technical and \ndigital specifications, visual rules (now sleep staging rules), arousal rules, cardiac rules \nand movement rules remains largely unchanged from the 2007 version. The 2007 \nmanual should be consulted for the development process of these chapters.\n3\n The Scoring \nManual Committee, two members of which also served on the SAD Task Force, drafted \nrules for a new respiratory chapter based on the recommendations in the SAD Task \nForce review paper.\n2\n Headings and formatting throughout the manual were edited for \nclarity and consistency. Critical terminology was made up-to-date and consistent. The \nuse of certain definitions in the manual was made into a rule to emphasize their \nimportance. Scoring manual FAQs from the AASM website were incorporated as notes \nin the appropriate sections of the manual. Already existing notes in the manual were \nexamined for relevance and clarity. New figures were designed for the sleep staging \nchapter that better illustrate the rules for scoring sleep stages. Upon completion of the \nedits, all rules, figures and notes were re-edited and re-voted on until there was \nconsensus agreement among the committee. The AASM Board of Directors approved \nVersion 2.0 of the scoring manual in July 2012. The Scoring Manual Committee was \nthen tasked to continuously review and update the manual in order to further clarify \nexisting rules and notes or to recommend revisions based on new clinical evidence or \nadvances in technology. The AASM Board of Directors reviews and approves all \nrevisions before a new version of the manual is published. \nAll scoring manual committee members completed AASM conflict of interest \nstatements. Scoring manual committee members did not have any level 1 conflicts of \ninterest with any medical device that might be affected by the development of any \nrecommendation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSummary and Future Editions \n \nAccording to the tenets of evidence-based medicine, clinical decision making should be \nguided by the best evidence from the research field, the expertise of the clinician, and \nthe expectations and values of the patient. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine \n(AASM) is committed to utilizing evidence-based medicine in the updating of The \nAASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events. Systematic literature \nsearches are conducted to collect all available evidence. Clinician content experts \nprovide guidance and feedback on drafts of potential rules. Sleep technologists and \nother sleep center staff contribute not only to expert opinion, but in communicating the \npriorities of the patient. Finally, the online format of the manual makes it particularly \namendable to new evidence in the literature and feedback from users and beneficiaries \nalike. \n \nReferences \n1.

Glossary of Terms \nAlpha rhythm (posterior dominant rhythm in adults and older children): An \nEEG pattern consisting of trains of sinusoidal 8-13 Hz activity recorded over \nthe occipital region with eye closure and attenuating with eye opening. \nApnea: Cessation of airflow (≥90% decrease in apnea sensor excursions \ncompared to baseline) of a minimum duration as defined by adult (VIII.C.1) \nand pediatric rules (VIII.D.1). Apneas are classified as obstructive, mixed, or \ncentral based on the pattern of respiratory effort. \nAsystole: An interruption of cardiac rhythm lasting more than 3 seconds. \nAtrial fibrillation: An irregularly irregular ventricular rhythm associated with \nreplacement of consistent P waves by rapid electrical oscillations. \nBeta rhythm: An EEG rhythm consisting of 13-30 Hz activity. \nBradycardia (during sleep): A sustained (>30 seconds) heart rate less than 40 \nbeats per minute for ages 6 years through adulthood. \nBruxism: Grinding or clenching of the teeth during sleep that is often associated \nwith arousal. (Scoring rule VII.E.1) \nCentral hypopnea: A specified reduction in airflow lasting at least 10 seconds in \nadults or the equivalent of 2 breaths in children during which there is no \nevidence of snoring, increased inspiratory flattening of the nasal pressure or \nPAP device flow signal compared to baseline breathing, or associated \nthoracoabdominal paradox. \nCheyne-Stokes breathing: A breathing rhythm with a specified crescendo and \ndecrescendo change in breathing amplitude separating central apneas or \nhypopneas. (Scoring rule for adults VIII.G.1) \nChronological age: The time elapsed since birth expressed in either days, \nmonths, or years; also referred to as postnatal or legal age. \nConceptional age (CA): Gestational age (GA) at birth plus the number of weeks \npostpartum. \nDelta frequency: An EEG rhythm consisting of 0-4 Hz activity. (See definition \nof slow wave activity.) \nDerivation: The recorded voltage difference between two electrodes (e.g. EEG, \nEOG, chin EMG derivations). \nExcessive fragmentary myoclonus: Limb EMG activity of a specified \nfrequency and duration often unassociated with visible movement. This \npolysomnographic finding is not thought to have physiological significance. \nExcessive transient muscle activity (phasic activity) in REM sleep: In a 30-\nsecond epoch of REM sleep divided into 10 sequential 3-second mini-epochs, \nat least 5 (50%) of the mini-epochs contain bursts of transient muscle activity. \nExcessive transient muscle activity bursts are 0.1-5.0 seconds in duration and \nat least 4 times as high in amplitude as the background EMG activity. \nEye blinks: Conjugate vertical eye movements at a frequency of 0.5-2 Hz present \nin wakefulness with the eyes open or closed. \nGestational age (GA): The time elapsed between the first day of the mother's \nlast menstrual period and the day of delivery expressed in completed weeks. If \nthe pregnancy was achieved using assisted reproductive technology, GA is \ncalculated by adding 2 weeks to the conceptional age. \n\nHigh voltage slow (HVS): Continuous synchronous symmetrical predominantly \nhigh voltage 1-3 Hz delta activity. \nHypnagogic foot tremor: Trains of EMG activity of the lower limb with a \nspecified frequency; not a defined disorder. \nHypnagogic hypersynchrony (HH): Paroxysmal bursts or runs of diffuse, high-\namplitude, sinusoidal, 75-350 μV, 3-4.5 Hz waves which begin abruptly, are \nusually widely distributed but often are maximal over the central, frontal, or \nfrontocentral scalp regions. These waveforms can occur in stage N1 and N2. \nHypnogram: A graphical representation of sleep stages which occur throughout \nthe night. \nHypopnea: A reduction in airflow with the minimum amplitude and duration as \nspecified in the hypopnea rules for adults (VIII.D.1A and B) and children \n(VIII.E.1). The reduction in airflow must be accompanied by a ≥3% \ndesaturation or an arousal (VIII.D.1A and VIII.E.1) or a ≥4% desaturation \n(VIII.D.1B). \nHypoventilation: A specified period of increased PCO\n2\n of >50 mmHg in \nchildren or >55 mmHg in adults, or a rise of PCO\n2\n during sleep of ≥10 mmHg \nthat exceeds 50 mmHg for a specified period of time in adults. \nK complex: A well-delineated, negative, sharp wave immediately followed by a \npositive component standing out from the background EEG, with total \nduration ≥0.5 seconds, usually maximal in amplitude when recorded using \nfrontal derivations. For an arousal to be associated with a K complex, the \narousal must either be concurrent with the K complex or commence no more \nthan 1 second after termination of the K complex. (see V. Arousal Rule). \nLow-amplitude, mixed-frequency (LAMF) activity: Low amplitude, \npredominantly 4-7 Hz activity. \nLow chin EMG tone: Baseline EMG activity in the chin derivation no higher \nthan in any other sleep stage and usually at the lowest level of the entire \nrecording. \nLow voltage irregular (LVI): Continuous low voltage mixed-frequency activity \nwith delta and predominantly theta activity. \nMajor body movement: Movement and muscle artifact obscuring the EEG for \nmore than half an epoch to the extent that the sleep stage cannot be \ndetermined. \nMonitoring time (MT): Total recording time minus periods of artifact and time \nthe patient was awake as determined by actigraphy, body position sensor, \nrespiratory pattern, or patient diary. \nNarrow complex tachycardia: A cardiac rhythm lasting a minimum of 3 \nconsecutive beats with QRS duration of <120 msec and a rate of >100 per \nminute. \nNasal pressure transducer: A pressure transducer that measures the pressure \n(relative to atmospheric pressure) inside the nasal orifice using a nasal \ncannula. The pressure difference across the nasal inlet during breathing is \nproportional to the magnitude of airflow squared. A square root transformation \nof the nasal pressure signal is proportional to airflow. The inspiratory \nwaveform of the nasal pressure signal exhibits a flattened pattern during \nairflow limitation provided the signal from the transducer is recorded as a DC \nsignal or as an AC signal with an appropriate low filter setting. \n\nOxygen desaturation index (ODI): The number of oxygen desaturations × 60 \ndivided by the monitoring time (for HSAT) or total sleep time (for in-lab \nPSG). \nPeriodic breathing: >3 episodes of central apnea lasting >3 seconds separated \nby no more than 20 seconds of normal breathing in children. \nPeriodic limb movements of sleep: Movements of the limbs during sleep \noccurring with a specified frequency, duration, and amplitude. \nPeripheral arterial tone: A measure of pulsatile volume changes at the finger tip \nthat reflects changes in sympathetic tone. \nPeripheral arterial tonometry (PAT): A technique allowing noninvasive \nmoment-to-moment measurement of sympathetic tone using finger \nplethysmography (measurement of pulsatile volume changes in the finger tip \nthat reflects changes in sympathetic tone). Increases in sympathetic tone result \nin peripheral arterial constriction and reduced blood flow to the digit. The \nreduced volume at the finger is detected by the probe. The combination of a \ndecrease in PAT signal (sympathetic tone increase following respiratory \nevents), a fall in SaO\n2\n (oximetry), and an increase in heart rate is used to detect \nrespiratory events. \nPositive airway pressure (PAP) flow: An airflow signal derived from a pressure \ntransducer built in to the PAP device. \nPosterior dominant rhythm (PDR): The dominant reactive EEG rhythm over \nthe occipital regions in relaxed wakefulness with eyes closed which is slower \nin infants and young children and attenuates with eye opening or attention. \nFrequency is 3.5-4.5 Hz when first seen in infants 3-4 months post-term, 5-6 \nHz by 5-6 months, and 7.5-9.5 Hz by 3 years of age and amplitude is usually \n>50 μV. In older children and adults, posterior dominant rhythm is often \nreferred to as alpha rhythm. \nPosterior slow waves of youth (PSW): Intermittent runs of bilateral but often \nasymmetric 2.5-4.5 Hz slow waves superimposed, riding upon, or fused with \nthe PDR, are usually <120% of PDR voltage, block with eye opening and \ndisappear with drowsiness and sleep. PSW are uncommon in children <2 years \nof age, have a maximal incidence between ages 8-14 years, and are uncommon \nafter age 21 years. \nPVDF sensor: Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) film is a fluoropolymer \nsubstance that reacts to changes in temperature when used as a thermal airflow \nsensor and to impedance changes when used as an effort sensor. \nPVDFsum: PVDFsum is the electrical sum of signals recorded from the thoracic \nand abdominal PVDF sensors. \nRapid eye movements (REMs): Eye movements recorded in the EOG \nderivations consisting of conjugate, irregular, sharply peaked eye movements \nwith an initial deflection usually lasting <500 msec. While rapid eye \nmovements are characteristic of stage R sleep, they may also be seen in \nwakefulness with eyes open when individuals visually scan the environment.   \nReading eye movements: Eye movements recorded in the EOG derivations \nconsisting of trains of conjugate eye movements characterized by an initial \nslow phase followed by a rapid phase in the opposite direction as the \nindividual reads. \nREM Sleep Behavior Disorder: A parasomnia characterized by relative atonia \nduring REM and associated with potentially harmful dream-enacting \nbehaviors. \n\nRespiratory effort-related arousal: A sequence of breaths characterized by \nincreasing respiratory effort (esophageal manometry); inspiratory flattening in \nthe nasal pressure or PAP device flow channel; or an increase in end-tidal \nPCO\n2\n (children) leading to an arousal from sleep. Respiratory effort-related \narousals do not meet criteria for hypopnea and have a minimum duration \nof ≥10 seconds in adults or the duration of at least two breaths in children. \nRespiratory event index (REI): Total number of respiratory events scored × 60 \ndivided by monitoring time (MT). \nRespiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP): A technology that uses \nalternating current in belts surrounding the thorax and abdomen to generate a \nsignal based on changes in the inductance of belts during breathing. The band \ninductance depends on the cross-sectional area encircled by the band. \nRhythmic Movement Disorder: Repetitive, stereotyped and rhythmic motor \nbehaviors that occur predominantly during drowsiness or sleep and involve \nlarge muscle groups. \nRIPflow: RIPflow is the time derivative of the RIPsum signal; excursions in the \nsignal are an estimate of airflow. \nRIPsum: RIPsum is the electrical sum of the signals from the thoracic and \nabdominal RIP sensors; excursions in the signal are an estimate of tidal \nvolume. \nSawtooth waves: An EEG pattern consisting of trains of sharply contoured or \ntriangular, often serrated, 2-6 Hz waves maximal in amplitude over the central \nhead regions and often, but not always, preceding a burst of rapid eye \nmovements. \nScanning eye movements: Trains of conjugate eye movements with eyes open \nconsisting of a slow phase followed by a rapid phase in the opposite direction \nas the infant visually scans the environment or follows objects. \nSleep onset: The start of the first epoch scored as any stage other than stage W. \n(In most subjects this will usually be the first epoch of stage N1.) \nSleep spindle: A train of distinct waves with frequency 11-16 Hz (most \ncommonly 12-14 Hz) with a duration ≥0.5 seconds, usually maximal in \namplitude over the central regions. \nSlow eye movements (SEM): Conjugate, reasonably regular, sinusoidal eye \nmovements with an initial deflection that usually lasts >500 msec. Slow eye \nmovements may be seen during eyes closed wake and stage N1. \nSlow wave activity: Waves of frequency 0.5-2 Hz and peak-to-peak amplitude \n>75 μV, measured over the frontal regions referenced to the contralateral ear \nor mastoid (F4-M1, F3-M2). \nSustained muscle activity (tonic activity) in REM sleep: An epoch of REM \nsleep with at least 50% of the duration of the epoch having a chin EMG \namplitude greater than the minimum amplitude demonstrated in NREM sleep. \nTachycardia or sinus tachycardia (during sleep): A sustained (>30 seconds) \nsinus heart rate >90 beats per minute for adults. \nThermal sensor: A thermally sensitive device that detects changes in nasal \nand/or oral airflow based on changes in temperature; thermal sensors include \nthermistors, thermocouples, or polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) airflow \nsensors. \nTheta rhythm: An EEG rhythm consisting of 4-7 Hz activity. \nTrace alternant (TA): Generally only seen in stage N sleep; characterized by at \nleast 3 alternating runs of bilaterally synchronous high voltage (50-150 μV ) \n\nbursts of 1-3 Hz delta activity lasting 5-6 seconds (range 3-8 seconds) \nalternating with period of lower amplitude (25-50 μV) 4-7 Hz theta activity \n(range 4-12 seconds). \nTransient muscle activity: Short irregular bursts of EMG activity usually with \nduration <0.25 seconds superimposed on low EMG tone. The activity may be \nseen in the chin or anterior tibial EMG derivations, as well as in EEG or EOG \ndeviations, the latter indicating activity of cranial nerve innervated muscles \n(facial and scalp muscles). The activity is often maximal when associated with \nrapid eye movements. \nVertex sharp waves (V waves): Sharply contoured waves with duration <0.5 \nseconds (as measured at the base of the wave), maximal over the central region \nand distinguishable from the background activity. They are most often seen \nduring transition to stage N1 sleep but can occur in either stage N1 or N2 \nsleep. These waveforms typically first appear at 4-6 months post-term. \nWide complex tachycardia: A cardiac rhythm lasting a minimum of 3 \nconsecutive beats with QRS duration ≥120 msec and a rate of >100 per \nminute.",
