- `ai_message_tag` - Categorizes AI messages with quality metrics
- `context_memory` - Stores ticket-specific memory and preferences
- `troubleshooting_flows` - Manages structured troubleshooting guides

**New API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/ai/feedback` - Submit feedback for AI responses
- `GET /api/ai/context/:ticketId` - Get ticket context
- `GET /api/ai/troubleshooting-flows` - List available flows
- `POST /api/ai/troubleshooting-flows/:flowId/execute` - Execute flow steps
- `POST /api/ai/analyze-clarity` - Analyze response clarity
- `GET /api/ai/memory/:ticketId` - Get context memory
- `POST /api/ai/check-duplicate` - Check for duplicate questions
- `GET /api/ai/stats` - Enhanced AI statistics

// Uses device info, conversation history, customer type
```

**Duplicate Detection Example:**
```javascript
// Checks if question already asked
const duplicateCheck = await enhancedAiService.checkForDuplicateQuestions(ticketId, question);
if (duplicateCheck.isDuplicate) {
  // Provides rephrased response instead
}
```

**Troubleshooting Flow Example:**
```javascript
// Matches customer message to known patterns
