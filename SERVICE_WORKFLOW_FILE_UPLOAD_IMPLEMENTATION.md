# Service Workflow File Upload Implementation

## Overview
Added comprehensive file upload functionality to the NeuroChat Service Workflow system. Users can now upload attachments to each step of the workflow process.

## ‚úÖ Implementation Summary

### Frontend Changes (ServiceWorkflow.tsx)

1. **Added File Upload Support**:
   - Imported `FileUpload` component
   - Added state management for attachments and upload progress
   - Added file upload handling functions
   - Added file field rendering in the form

2. **New State Variables**:
   ```typescript
   const [attachments, setAttachments] = useState<any>({});  // Store attachments per step
   const [uploadingFiles, setUploadingFiles] = useState<any>({});  // Track upload progress
   ```

3. **New Functions**:
   - `loadStepAttachments(stepId)` - Load existing attachments for a step
   - `handleFileUpload(stepId, fieldName, files)` - Handle file upload process
   - `removeAttachment(stepId, attachmentId, fieldName)` - Remove uploaded files

4. **File Field Rendering**:
   - Added `case 'file':` to the `renderField()` switch statement
   - Displays file upload component when editing
   - Shows list of uploaded files with download/remove options
   - Supports multiple file uploads per field

### Backend Changes

1. **New API Endpoints**:
   - `GET /api/service-workflows/steps/:stepId/attachments` - Get attachments for a step
   - `DELETE /api/service-workflows/attachments/:attachmentId` - Delete an attachment
   - (Existing) `POST /api/service-workflows/:workflowId/steps/:stepId/attachments` - Upload attachment

2. **Service Updates** (serviceWorkflowService.js):
   - Added `deleteAttachment(attachmentId)` method
   - Enhanced existing `getStepAttachments(stepId)` method
   - Improved audit logging for file operations

}
```

### Where File Uploads Are Available

## üéØ User Experience

### File Upload Process
1. **Edit Mode**: Click "Edit Step" to enable file uploads
2. **Drag & Drop**: Use the file upload component to select files
3. **Progress Tracking**: See upload progress indicator
4. **File Management**: View, download, or remove uploaded files
5. **Save Step**: Files are automatically linked to the step when saved

### File Display
- **File List**: Shows all uploaded files with icons
- **File Info**: Displays original filename and file size
- **Actions**: Download and remove buttons for each file
- **Permissions**: Only editing mode allows file uploads/removals

## üîß Technical Implementation

### File Storage
- Files stored in `/uploads/workflows/` directory
- Unique filenames: `timestamp-uuid.extension`
- Database records track file metadata and associations

### Security Features
- **Authentication**: All endpoints require valid JWT token
- **File Validation**: Type and size validation on client and server
- **Access Control**: Users can only access files from their workflows
- **Audit Trail**: All file operations are logged

### API Integration
- Uses existing `apiService` for consistent error handling
- Implements proper loading states and error messages
- Supports both single and multiple file uploads

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Open a service workflow
2. Navigate to any step with attachment fields
3. Click "Edit Step"
4. Upload files using the file upload component
5. Verify files appear in the list
6. Test download functionality
7. Test file removal
8. Save the step and verify persistence

### File Types to Test
- PDF documents
- Image files (JPG, PNG)
- Office documents (DOC, XLS)
- Large files (near 200MB limit)
- Multiple files at once

## üöÄ Benefits

1. **Complete Documentation**: Every workflow step can have supporting files
2. **Audit Trail**: Full tracking of who uploaded what and when
3. **Easy Access**: Files available throughout the workflow process
4. **Professional Reports**: Attachments can be referenced in PDF reports
5. **Customer Service**: Better documentation for customer interactions

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

1. **File Previews**: In-browser preview for images and PDFs
2. **File Categories**: Organize files by type (photos, documents, reports)
3. **Bulk Operations**: Upload/download multiple files at once
4. **File Versioning**: Track file changes over time
5. **Integration**: Link files to PDF report generation

## üêõ Fix Applied: File Download Issue

### Issue
The download functionality was not working because:
1. Backend had no download endpoint for workflow attachments
2. Frontend was using incorrect download link (`/uploads/${attachment.fileName}`)
3. Files were not properly saved to the workflow directory

### Solution Implemented
1. **Backend**: Added download endpoint `/api/service-workflows/attachments/:attachmentId/download`
2. **Backend**: Added `getAttachment(attachmentId)` method to service
3. **Backend**: Fixed file handling to properly move files from multer temp location to `uploads/workflows/`
4. **Frontend**: Replaced direct link with API call using `downloadAttachment()` function
5. **Frontend**: Proper authentication and blob handling for downloads

### Technical Changes
- **Backend**: New download endpoint with proper authentication and file serving
- **Backend**: Fixed `uploadAttachment()` method to actually save files to filesystem
- **Frontend**: New `downloadAttachment()` function using fetch API with authentication
- **Frontend**: Changed download button to use API endpoint instead of direct file link

## ‚úÖ Status: **IMPLEMENTED AND READY**

The file upload functionality is now fully implemented and ready for use in the service workflow system. Users can upload, view, download, and manage files for each step of the workflow process. **The download issue has been fixed.**
