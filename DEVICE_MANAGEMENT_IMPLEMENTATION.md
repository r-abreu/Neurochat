## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### For Agents:
1. **Access Devices**: Click "Devices" in the sidebar (requires `devices.view` permission)
2. **Browse Devices**: Use filters and search to find specific devices
3. **View Details**: Click any device row to see detailed information
4. **Edit Device**: Click "Edit Device" button to update warranty, invoice, and comments
5. **View Linked Tickets**: Click "View Ticket" for any linked ticket
6. **Export Data**: Use "Export" button to download device list

### For System Administrators:
1. **Permissions**: Grant device permissions (`devices.view`, `devices.edit`, `devices.create`, `devices.delete`) to appropriate roles
2. **Database**: Run the migration script to add device tables
3. **Auto-Creation**: Devices are automatically created when tickets include device information

## 🔄 Automatic Workflows

### Device Auto-Creation:
1. User creates/updates ticket with device model and serial number
2. System checks if device with that serial number exists
3. If not found, creates new device linked to customer
4. Links ticket to device automatically
5. Device appears in device management list

### Data Synchronization:
- Device information automatically stays in sync with ticket data
- Customer information is pulled from user records
- Ticket counts are calculated in real-time

## 📊 Analytics & Reporting

### Device Statistics:
- Total devices count
- Active warranties vs expired
- Devices expiring soon (30 days)
- Model breakdown
- Warranty status distribution

### Export Capabilities:
- Export device list to Excel/CSV
- Include all device information
- Filter data before export
- Formatted for reporting
