# Fix for Service Workflow Report "N/A" Fields

## Problem Identified
The PDF reports show "N/A" for most fields because the workflow steps don't contain populated data. The report generation system is working correctly, but it has no data to extract from the workflow steps.

## Root Cause
- Service workflow steps are created with default null values
- Users must manually enter data into each step through the UI
- When no data is entered, the PDF report defaults to "N/A" for empty fields

## Solution Steps

### 1. Open NeuroChat Frontend
Navigate to: http://localhost:3000

### 2. Open a Ticket with Service Workflow
- Find a ticket in the system
- Click the "Service Workflow" button
- If no workflow exists, create one

### 3. Populate Each Step with Data

#### Step 1: Request Device for Repair
- **Defect Description**: Enter detailed description of the issue
- **Customer Tracking Number**: Enter customer's tracking reference
- **Assigned Agent**: Select responsible agent
- **Comments**: Add any relevant notes

#### Step 2: Ship Loaner to Customer (if applicable)
- **Send Loaner**: Toggle to Yes if sending loaner
- **Loaner Model**: Enter loaner device model
- **Loaner Serial Number**: Enter loaner device serial
- **Tracking Number**: Enter shipping tracking number
- **Shipment Date**: Select shipping date

#### Step 3: Receiving, Inspection & Cleaning
- **Received Date**: Enter date device was received
- **Cleaning Date**: Enter date device was cleaned  
- **Product ID Confirmation**: Enter confirmation date
- **Received Parts**: Add parts table with part details
- **Inspection Comments**: Enter inspection findings

#### Step 4: Defect Analysis
- **Analysis Date**: Enter analysis completion date
- **Findings Description**: Detailed analysis results
- **Replacement Parts**: Add required parts table
- **Diagnostic Summary**: Summary of diagnostic tests

#### Step 5: Quote & Approval
- **Quote Number**: Enter quote reference number
- **Quote Date**: Enter quote creation date
- **Approval Status**: Set to "approved" 
- **Approval Date**: Enter approval date
- **Invoice Number**: Enter invoice number

#### Step 6: Correction and Technical Report
- **Correction Date**: Enter repair completion date
- **Repair Description**: Detailed repair description
- **Parts Used**: Add table of parts used in repair
- **Test Checklist**: Complete all test items
- **Final Repair Approval**: Set to approved

### 4. Generate PDF Report
After populating the steps with data:
- Click "Generate New Report" button
- The report should now show the populated data instead of "N/A"

## Technical Details

### How the Report Generation Works
1. **Data Extraction**: `pdfReportService.extractStepData()` pulls data from workflow.steps array
2. **Field Mapping**: Each step's data is mapped to report fields using multiple fallback patterns:
   ```javascript
   const defectDescription = step1Data.defectDescription || step1Data.defect_description || ticket?.description || 'N/A';
   ```
3. **HTML Generation**: Data is inserted into HTML template with "N/A" fallbacks for missing data

### Available Field Mappings
The report service maps these workflow step fields to report sections:

**Step 1 Fields**:
- `defectDescription` → Defect Description
- `deviceSerialNumber` → Serial Number  
- `customerTrackingNumber` → Customer Tracking

**Step 2 Fields**:
- `loanerModel` → Loaner Model
- `loanerSerialNumber` → Loaner Serial
- `loanerTrackingNumber` → Loaner Tracking

**Step 3 Fields**:
- `receivedDate` → Date Received
- `cleaningDate` → Cleaning Date
- `receivedParts` → Received Parts Table
- `inspectionComments` → Inspection Comments

**Step 4 Fields**:
- `analysisDate` → Analysis Date
- `findingsDescription` → Findings Description
- `replacementParts` → Replacement Parts Table
- `diagnosticSummary` → Diagnostic Summary

**Step 5 Fields**:
- `quoteNumber` → Quote Number
- `invoiceNumber` → Invoice Number
- `approvalDate` → Approval Date

**Step 6 Fields**:
- `correctionDate` → Correction Date
- `repairDescription` → Repair Description
- `partsUsed` → Parts Used Table
- `testChecklist` → Test Checklist
- `repairAgentId` → Service Responsible (agent name lookup)

### Complex Field Types
- **Parts Tables**: JSON arrays formatted as HTML tables
- **Checklists**: JSON objects formatted as pass/fail lists  
- **Agent Names**: Agent IDs resolved to full names using users array
- **Dates**: ISO strings formatted to local date format

## Verification Steps
1. Populate workflow step data through the UI
2. Generate new PDF report
3. Check that fields show actual data instead of "N/A"
4. Verify complex fields (parts tables, checklists) render properly

## Future Improvements
- **Auto-populate with sample data**: Add "Fill Sample Data" button for testing
- **Data validation**: Ensure required fields are completed before report generation
- **Template customization**: Allow report field customization
- **Bulk data import**: Allow CSV/Excel import of workflow data
